Now @KinbergBatra is proposed as new leader of Moderate Party. Experienced and committed. Knows Europe and economy well. And politics.

Nobel days. The world comes to Stockholm. One can follow some of the fascinating dialogues online. #nobeldialogue http://t.co/wnr2v46g3Z
It’s not really that Russia’s economy is doing so stellar that massive increase in military spending comes by itself. http://t.co/eF1i6FpQJj
A 30% increase in Russia defence sounding 2015 is a signal worth noting. Everything else in the country is minus. http://t.co/r5tEI4hNm1
Rays of sunshine with new government of Ukraine. But momentous challenges ahead. http://t.co/BcpXU2NbyD
Monday. New week. New things to do. Will mostly be in Stockholm. Well, with Berlin and Lisbon as the exceptions.
Russia has been flying Tu95 strategic bombers over the Baltic Sea. I doubt this has ever happened before. Certainly not in recent decades.
Now PM Löfven in @svtagenda. Then more on political crisis. And also me on Russian information operations. http://t.co/4KY2J30I6W
If you happen to be heading for Baltistan these days it looks rather problematic. http://t.co/MVrIqtLLFn

“Russia prepared to use military means to achieve its foreign policy goals—and to re-draw map of Europe in process.” http://t.co/6FCb9Tiypj
New steps to limit free speech and free journalism in Azerbaijan. This damages country’s standing and possibilities. http://t.co/kn1Siegxb7
What we also see across Europe is a fragmentation of the political landscape. New anti-most-things populist parties appearing. Complicates.
Yes, it is a fact that the centre-left looks weaker and weaker across Europe. There are few exceptions to the trend. http://t.co/FPWXQ0Lqop
Good @FedericaMog and @JHahnEU visit to Bosnia. But only common commitment by Bosnia’s leader will bring country forward. Lacking so far.
Net freedom in the world in decline for 4th year. 36 out of 65 countries assessed negative. Highly worrying. https://t.co/Dfng6YPISV
It was in ancient Greek city of Chersonesus that Viking Prince Valdemar of Kiev was baptised.  Thin basis for Moscow claims on Crimea.

Terrorism in Russia. Street battle in Grozny. Moscow should have more pressing priorities than destabilising Ukraine. http://t.co/drxS8fTPZs
Important that the issue of global flow security is attracting increasing attention. Securing globalisation. http://t.co/NV7HXfD7kS
Critical mistake of PM Löfven was to abandon previous agreements with Alliance parties and let the Left Party dictate. Burned bridges.
Sweden hasn’t had an extraordinary election since 1958. Unique crisis. Very little will be the same after this.
Here we go - parliament will be dissolved with new elections March 22. Red-green government collapsed.
Budget of centre-right opposition approved by Parliament and will now apply for all of 2015. Absolutely unique situation.

Helsinki airport very late in the evening. No crisis whatsoever here. Pleasant place for a while.
Hardly surprising that I prefer Parliament to decide on alliance budget alternative than red-green one. Anything else would be sensational.
Prime Minister dissolves parliament and calls for new elections. In Israel.
Chaos and turmoil in the politics of Sweden. Red-green government likely collapses. Was bound to happen sooner or later. This was sooner.
Looks likely that Parliament tomorrow will approve the budget proposal of the opposition Alliance parties. Better for the country.

Moldova under PM @IurieLeanca has important reforms and moved gradually towards EU. But Moscow wants to press it into Eurasian Union.

Several experts warn of underestimating the attractiveness of ISIL. Long struggle ahead. Should it be soundly defeated or slowly contained?
Taliban was first the effort at building a fundamentalist totalitarian state. It failed as such even before 2001. Will ISIL avoid same fate?
What is ISIL? Long discussion. Certainly a totalitarian movement. We have seen such before. But its state-building efforts likely to fail.
In 1978 Iran GDP per capita was twice that of Turkey. Today’s it’s half. There is a clear lesson in these figures. Very clear.
We did not accept Saddam Hussein’s smash-and-grap invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Putin’s Crimea invasion and annexation no different.
President Obama both wants to avoid a bomb in Iran and bombing Iran. Desirable and should be achievable.

Estimates now that app 18.000 fighters from around the world have sought to join ISIL and its fight. We must do more to try to stop this.
Is an unjust peace in Syria better than a just war? Already lost half GDP. Massive destruction. Many millions displaced. No end in sight.
In Israel settlers are now not only occupying West Bank but also the government. Seriously blocking any way forward for a peace process.
Also signs that ISIL governance is seen as failing by many in Mosul. Might be difficult for ISIL to hold on for a long time there.
Five months after taking Mosul signs that ISIL is financially strained. Reducing pay to fighters. Air strikes reduced oil production.
Dinner in the desert of Arabia with old and new friends. Despair over peace process Israel-Palestine. Deep concern over everything else.

I very much regret that we not yet have a real Palestine state. Occupation is the brutal reality. We should not forget that.
