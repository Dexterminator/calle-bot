Tomorrow evening I'm at NZZ Podium in Berlin discussing the politics of Europe. The event is already fully booked. http://t.co/RgswMoexrv
Now @KinbergBatra is proposed as new leader of Moderate Party. Experienced and committed. Knows Europe and economy well. And politics.
Will aging societies by less dynamic? How do we preserve the vibrancy and restlessness that carries us forward? #nobeldialogue
Nobel days. The world comes to Stockholm. One can follow some of the fascinating dialogues online. #nobeldialogue http://t.co/wnr2v46g3Z
It’s not really that Russia’s economy is doing so stellar that massive increase in military spending comes by itself. http://t.co/eF1i6FpQJj
A 30% increase in Russia defence sounding 2015 is a signal worth noting. Everything else in the country is minus. http://t.co/r5tEI4hNm1
Rays of sunshine with new government of Ukraine. But momentous challenges ahead. http://t.co/BcpXU2NbyD
Monday. New week. New things to do. Will mostly be in Stockholm. Well, with Berlin and Lisbon as the exceptions.
Russia has been flying Tu95 strategic bombers over the Baltic Sea. I doubt this has ever happened before. Certainly not in recent decades.
Now PM Löfven in @svtagenda. Then more on political crisis. And also me on Russian information operations. http://t.co/4KY2J30I6W
If you happen to be heading for Baltistan these days it looks rather problematic. http://t.co/MVrIqtLLFn

“Russia prepared to use military means to achieve its foreign policy goals—and to re-draw map of Europe in process.” http://t.co/6FCb9Tiypj
New steps to limit free speech and free journalism in Azerbaijan. This damages country’s standing and possibilities. http://t.co/kn1Siegxb7
What we also see across Europe is a fragmentation of the political landscape. New anti-most-things populist parties appearing. Complicates.
Yes, it is a fact that the centre-left looks weaker and weaker across Europe. There are few exceptions to the trend. http://t.co/FPWXQ0Lqop
Good @FedericaMog and @JHahnEU visit to Bosnia. But only common commitment by Bosnia’s leader will bring country forward. Lacking so far.
Net freedom in the world in decline for 4th year. 36 out of 65 countries assessed negative. Highly worrying. https://t.co/Dfng6YPISV
It was in ancient Greek city of Chersonesus that Viking Prince Valdemar of Kiev was baptised.  Thin basis for Moscow claims on Crimea.

Terrorism in Russia. Street battle in Grozny. Moscow should have more pressing priorities than destabilising Ukraine. http://t.co/drxS8fTPZs
Important that the issue of global flow security is attracting increasing attention. Securing globalisation. http://t.co/NV7HXfD7kS
Critical mistake of PM Löfven was to abandon previous agreements with Alliance parties and let the Left Party dictate. Burned bridges.
Sweden hasn’t had an extraordinary election since 1958. Unique crisis. Very little will be the same after this.
Here we go - parliament will be dissolved with new elections March 22. Red-green government collapsed.
Budget of centre-right opposition approved by Parliament and will now apply for all of 2015. Absolutely unique situation.

Helsinki airport very late in the evening. No crisis whatsoever here. Pleasant place for a while.
Hardly surprising that I prefer Parliament to decide on alliance budget alternative than red-green one. Anything else would be sensational.
Prime Minister dissolves parliament and calls for new elections. In Israel.
Chaos and turmoil in the politics of Sweden. Red-green government likely collapses. Was bound to happen sooner or later. This was sooner.
Looks likely that Parliament tomorrow will approve the budget proposal of the opposition Alliance parties. Better for the country.

Moldova under PM @IurieLeanca has important reforms and moved gradually towards EU. But Moscow wants to press it into Eurasian Union.

Several experts warn of underestimating the attractiveness of ISIL. Long struggle ahead. Should it be soundly defeated or slowly contained?
Taliban was first the effort at building a fundamentalist totalitarian state. It failed as such even before 2001. Will ISIL avoid same fate?
What is ISIL? Long discussion. Certainly a totalitarian movement. We have seen such before. But its state-building efforts likely to fail.
In 1978 Iran GDP per capita was twice that of Turkey. Today’s it’s half. There is a clear lesson in these figures. Very clear.
We did not accept Saddam Hussein’s smash-and-grap invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Putin’s Crimea invasion and annexation no different.
President Obama both wants to avoid a bomb in Iran and bombing Iran. Desirable and should be achievable.

Estimates now that app 18.000 fighters from around the world have sought to join ISIL and its fight. We must do more to try to stop this.
Is an unjust peace in Syria better than a just war? Already lost half GDP. Massive destruction. Many millions displaced. No end in sight.
In Israel settlers are now not only occupying West Bank but also the government. Seriously blocking any way forward for a peace process.
Also signs that ISIL governance is seen as failing by many in Mosul. Might be difficult for ISIL to hold on for a long time there.
Five months after taking Mosul signs that ISIL is financially strained. Reducing pay to fighters. Air strikes reduced oil production.
Dinner in the desert of Arabia with old and new friends. Despair over peace process Israel-Palestine. Deep concern over everything else.

Excellent and important report on The New Climate Economy. It's possible! Will be discussed here today. http://t.co/wjAzo1Fl1i
Today is the day of the Climate Summit here in New York. PM Reinfeldt will be there with the record of Sweden. http://t.co/PiG1YdkJmr
From Harvard to New York and straight into informal dinner with FM’s engaged in the issues of the Middle East. They are not getting easier.
Great discussions with the scholars and students at Harvard together with @SenatoreMonti. http://t.co/3t1pyH2TEx
Here is a live stream from our discussions at Harvard University on Ukraine and Europe.  http://t.co/nIjDN4T1pV
Was meeting between the Iran and Saudi Arabia FM’s the most significant during the big UN week this year? We’ll see. http://t.co/FucNapy3sM
The Crimson gives you everything that will be happening at the Harvard campus this very day. http://t.co/5NnNsY8l7w
At Harvard to discuss Europe and Ukraine tomorrow with former Italy  PM Monti and others at @ces_harvard. https://t.co/EntEPvDtJI
Good with a decent bookstore. At Harvard Square in Cambridge. Difficult decisions... http://t.co/wfOhCIT2Ka
Congratulations to @ashrafghani on being elected new President of Afghanistan.  A good friend. http://t.co/0fxbj5icxP
There is another Russia. And there is hope for Europe. http://t.co/KMuHvd1llB
About to take off from slightly rainy Oslo. Destination first New York and then Boston. A day over the Atlantic. http://t.co/ulEtiFQJdh
Leaving excellent discussions at #IISS_GSR. Key question: Do we have enough policy bandwidth to deal with all the challenges of today?
Horrible news of new ISIL offensive. 70.000 Syrian Kurds flee to Turkey in just 24 hours. http://t.co/EQxWO5KJQF
I warmly welcome signing of National Unity Agreement in Kabul. It paves way for a democratic and stable transition.  http://t.co/2wSYzi7ZhV
Briefly attending energy session at #IISS_GSR. Great uncertainty on Russia-China gas deal. Key issues evidently not settled.
I'm honoured to be asked to become a member of the Council of the @IISS_org. A premier forum for the truly vital global strategic dialogues.
Good question without clear answer: is there any deal with Iran that Israel will not oppose and US Congress will not try to stop? #IISS_GSR
Now see fourth frozen conflict on border of Russia, and fifth such sustained by the armed forces of the Russian federation. #IISS_GSR
Whether a final deal on Iran nuclear issue is possible now is uncertain, but no one wants to break off or head to a new conflict. #IISS_GSR
In #IISS_GSR discussion @BarhamSalih stresses need for political arrangement and local legitimacy to fight ISIL successfully in Iraq.
I couldn't be at the UN for the Iraq meeting yesterday, but noted what Norway FM @borgebrende had to say. http://t.co/uX55Yw74cS
Starting day at #iiss_gsr in Oslo with continued discussion of consequences of Russia aggression against Ukraine. http://t.co/IMLOv3vDDl
Although he moves up in hierarchy of Poland I'm sad to see  @sikorskiradek leave as FM. He has been a star on the EU foreign policy scene.
Russian ambassador has just received a protest against the grave violation of Swedish airspace by Russian fighters-bombers on Wednesday.
Final count shows red and green parties in parliament increasing their share of votes since 2010 by 0,01%. Most impressive.
Taking off for Oslo and @IISS_org great conference there. Norway FM @borgebrende will however be in New York for UNSC session on Iraq.
EU condemns repression in Eritrea, including illegal imprisonment of the Eritrean-EU citizen Dawit Isaak. http://t.co/ofH2doodMW
The United Kingdom stays united. So must Europe.
Here is the full text of Ukraine President Poroshenko speech to the U.S. Congress yesterday. http://t.co/jvF0E3YSmK
Fairly obvious that Moscow is using combination of pressure and salami tactics to try to ravel EU-Ukraine agreement. http://t.co/tEd4KRH556
We have to wait for the morning to know the outcome of today's Battle of Britain. Of momentous importance.
Pr Poroshenko: "Not only a Ukrainian war. It is Europe's and it is America's too. It is a war for the free world." http://t.co/UhD2j0LAjN
Another cabinet meeting, but with no major decisions taken. We are in between the election result and a new government coming into office.
I hope we will not see the balkanisation of the British isles. Europe and the world needs a strong and vibrant United Kingdom.
Now seems as if the red and green parties did not gain 0,1% in our election  - in fact they didn't increase their share at all. Interesting.
Still wonderful weather here in Stockholm. But the old government is, of course, still in office.
Well, the Vikings certainly got a bad press. But, yes, the relative reality might have been somewhat better. http://t.co/WPsSpH7YG0
A very length briefing for both Foreign and Defence Committee of Parliament on both Ukraine/Russia and the wider Baltic area.
Seems as if Narva in Estoniahas acquired a new importance - where Russians can buy the food they want, http://t.co/KdAoF8u23K
Synchronised ratification today by European Parliament and Ukraine Rada of Association Agreement EU-Ukraine.   http://t.co/S8GtZAM9a8
I see that today's editorial in Financial Times regrets the demise of "one of the most competent reform governments in the EU". That's life.
A new day slowly arrives by the cradle of democracy. But I'm on my way back to Stockholm. http://t.co/IZBKTkNvjk
Arrived here and heading directly to @AthensForum to discuss the state of democracy in our world of today. http://t.co/To01VLMYR5
Elections in Thüringen and Brandenburg in Germany also gives ground for concern. The continued rise of the populist right in Europe.
Today I'm off to @Athensforum to discuss democracy under pressure. It's International Day of Democracy today.  http://t.co/IKPWh6Nb0Z
It is something of a chock with the right populist Sweden Democrats with 13% emerging as third largest party of the country.
PM Reinfeldt will offer resignation tomorrow. But government stays until parliament reconvenes Sept 30 and forming of new government starts.
Problematic election result tonight. Alliance government lost, but only populist right won. Red and green parties far from majority.
A steady stream of voters on this most pleasant day. Here to the polling station in my old school Östra Real. http://t.co/III0CYSkH1
Election day in Sweden. A day of reflection, calm and ultimate decision. And a sunny and pleasant day here in Stockholm.

It was a pleasure to meet youth activists from Ukraine observing the final day of our election campaign. http://t.co/SwQUW2NV81
Are Russian forces trying to capture Donetsk airport? If that is the case then it's a clear Moscow violation of ceasefire agreement.
Important message from @CommissionerHR: "Human rights abuses in Crimea need to be addressed."
Back on the campaign trail. With FinMin Anders Borg and Min Infrastructure @elmsatersvard. In central Stockholm. http://t.co/fd9LJsQ9lo

I had time to attend the usual "family photo" with Nordic and Baltic FM's in Tallinn before heading back home. http://t.co/Xx3qRABB8Z
Sorry not to be able to join friends at @yes_ukraine in Kiev today. Election campaign at home. But our support for Ukraine remains strong.
We are all obviously very concerned with the Russian abduction of an Estonian policeman. It is a serious matter. He must be released.
Enjoyable and most useful dinner with Nordic and Baltic FM's in the fog somewhere outside of Tallinn. Pity @borgebrende had to stay in Oslo.
"Sweden has played a bigger part in Europe and on the world stage than its 10m-odd population would seem to justify." http://t.co/LgPRvQtgd4
Reinforced EU sanctions against Russia now go into effect. Future dependent on developments. As before. http://t.co/pQ7RQ9mddV
Leaving ministry in Stockholm and heading to Tallinn and dinner there with all the Nordic and Baltic FM's. Much too discuss these days.
Impressive campaign teams across the country. Here in Västerås earlier today. http://t.co/ynPLHDw6ct
And now for campaign meeting in Västerås. Our alliance campaign is clearly having a good momentum now. Three days to go!
New figures out this morning shows nearly 100.000 new jobs in Sweden during the past year. A most impressive performance!
Starting this day with cabinet meeting. Decision to submit agreements with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia for ratification.
Nomination of @MalmstromEU as Trade Commissioner has been warmly welcomed on both sides of the Atlantic.  http://t.co/80z2fbLy1h
A long but most enjoyable day of campaigning in Östergötland region. Now back to Stockholm through the misty late summer night.
"Swedes value the benefits of being in the EU, and clearly favor a forward-leaning foreign policy." http://t.co/YuXovjNJvK
Swedes also approve of the way government is managing relations with Russia: 56%  http://t.co/YuXovjNJvK
In Sweden 74% supports government handling of foreign policy. Very high. EU average is 52% and US is 35%. http://t.co/tm56SigkPU
Apart from key TTIP talks with US the trade portfolio @malmstromEU also includes DCFTA implementation with Eastern Partnership counties.
I should also congratulate on Denmark’s @vestager for important competition EU portfolio.  A good liberal.
Congratulations @JunckerEU for appointing @MalmstromEU as Trade Commissioner. Excellent for all of Europe!  http://t.co/ET3STevX4M
“It’s like sitting in a bath full of gasoline and looking for the matches”, says Swe Trade Union chief in FT on our election. Strange.
On my way to Norrköping for campaign with @CarlssonSwe and @AnnaMariaCB. And then onwards to Linköping with also @KinbergBatra.
Excellent with the new EU-Canada Strategic Partnership Agreement. Much to do together! @HonJohnBaird  http://t.co/nbraGymRzj

Very worrying news from Kabul with stalemate in political talks and continued dispute over election result. Risks the progress we have done.

Why #RussiaInvadedUkraine Matters.
http://t.co/F5E5rbvzFK
Since crisis started 2008 Sweden’s economy has grown 7%. EU as a whole down 1,3%. Denmark and Finland even more. Norway up only 4%.
Since 2006 we have added 300.000 new jobs to the Swedish economy. Most other countries have unfortunately gone the other way.
A week to go until Swedish election. Race tightening. A united Alliance versus the divided red and green parties. Also on foreign policy.
Very true by @ECFR on EU need to keep focus on Balkans. That’s also why an enlargement commissioner is a necessity. http://t.co/a1XBQ74FqN
Looks like Scotland independence referendum will be a true cliffhanger. Result has vast implications for all of Europe.
Sincerely hope that recent ceasefire in easternmost Ukraine will hold. Russian forces must be withdrawn from Ukraine territory.
And now approaching take off from Copenhagen to Stockholm. Managed to get on an earlier flight. Home, sweet home.
Hög tid att rösta runt om i världen! Får inte missas! http://t.co/4VP9yebwmH
Well, I don't know what they do at @NATOWales today, but here it's full speed ahead. http://t.co/UeWTeOcbR7
Early morning. Taking off from Heathrow. For Copenhagen. Campaigning in Southern Sweden during the day.
Here my interview with @camanpour on CNN from @NATOWales yesterday evening. http://t.co/EagSmHGHau
This photo hardly looks real. But it actually is. Nice crowd. And we had a more relaxed time than it looks. http://t.co/zo1ndFjlhF
Leaving Newport and @NATOWales after most productive day. Our partnership with NATO of growing importance. We build security together.
I don't know why everyone else is looking at the photographers. I have seen such before. http://t.co/91kXqfgGPS
Talk of ceasefire in Ukraine. Would be welcome. To be serious should incl withdrawal of Russian forces and Ukraine controlling its border.
Media have set up their stations with view of golf course with APC's. Slightly bizarre. http://t.co/kLZm95k0uH
Hectic schedule with meetings at @NATOWales. Concluded meeting on Afghanistan. But many discussions on Russia and Ukraine in the margins.
Morning in Bristol. More than 70 delegations from all over the world for @NATOWales. Russia aggression, defence of Europe and ISIL in focus.
Rumours in Brussels that @JunckerEU intends to abolish Commissioner for Enlargement. Very bad signal. Abdication of responsibility.
France doesn’t consider time for delivery of Mistral to Russia to be appropriate. That’s an understatement. But certainly a good decision.
Was interviewed by @Aljazeera before leaving Brussels and heading to @NATO Wales. http://t.co/9wf6or1m15
Taking off for first Brussels for @eu_eeas meeting and then for Bristol and the @NATOWales summit.
Estonia President @IlvesToomas takes the opportunity of press conference to highlight net freedom and the Nordic region of prosperity.

15 UN peacekeepers have been killed in Mali so far this year. Sweden is preparing to deploy to UN force there. http://t.co/KXMegg6rkv
Immediate increase in defence spending in Sweden to increase readiness and training. This in addition to substantial long term increases.
From early tomorrow morning @errnews will bring live coverage of President Obama’s visit to the foreign capital closest to Stockholm.
US advance aircraft for President Obama’s visit to Tallinn tomorrow are now descending also on nearby Helsinki. http://t.co/FNj9j5PEhz
Good on Finland managing its relationship with Eastern neighbour: credible defense and a strong free-market system. http://t.co/mo2ZOjcmB4
Pipelines for reserve flow of gas from EU into Ukraine opened today by Slovakia. An important step.
Internet Governance Forum #IGF2014 opening in Istanbul. Important discussions on net freedom and net governance. @OurInternetGCIG is there.
Israel decision to expropriate almost 990 acres of privately owned Palestinian land near Bethlehem risks further undermining peace efforts.
Russian forces inside Ukraine continue their offensive against Ukraine forces. Consolidating and slightly enlarging the separatist enclave.
Today it’s 75 years since the start of Second World War. The pact with Stalin paved the way for Hitler to attack Poland.
Frankfurt Airport. Slightly messy on evening like this. Solid Sunday newspapers. A pleasure. Soon taking off for Stockholm. Much to do.
Sorry I can’t join @StefanFuleEU and FM friends in Chisinau tonight for Friends of Moldova meeting. Sweden calling. But our support clear.
Was a good talk in Brussels yesterday between Ukraine President Poroshenko and our PM Reinfeldt. http://t.co/pC6Otb5O21
EU leaders clear in condemning “the aggression by Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil.” http://t.co/FJLvYw4iUK
End of our EU FM Milano meeting. Dominated by new Russia aggression in Ukraine and consequences. Baton over to meeting of PM’s in Brussels.
PM Reinfeldt will have a bilateral meeting with Ukraine President Poroshenko in Brussels later today. Express Sweden’s support to Ukraine.
Very little doubt now that Russia will use also its regular armed forces to try to carve out a Novorossyia semi-state from Ukraine.
Important commitment by the Turkish leadership to intensify efforts to settle the Kurdish issue. http://t.co/CBN1rulHRJ
Second day of informal EU FM meeting here in Milano. Yesterday dominated by profound discussion on Russia. We are in new situation.

Congratulations to new Turkey FM Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. I hope he continues his previous European political orientation.
We must call a spade a spade:  this is the 2nd Russian invasion of Ukraine within a year.
Landed in Milan. Flew here in a Boeing 717, although for me it’s still a DC9. A classic that never loses its attraction.
Taking off for Milan and informal meeting of EU FM’s there. Agenda fairly obvious. EU has never been as challenged in its neighbourhood.
Talked with @BBCWorld about alarming escalation of Russia activities against and in Ukraine. UN Security Council ought to address situation.
Independent Russian media reports burials of paratroopers in Pskov. http://t.co/d6ylEygbbj
Cabinet meeting this morning. I briefed also on the escalation of Russian military moves against Ukraine. Key EU and NATO meetings upcoming.
We are now evidently seeing fighting between regular Russian and regular Ukrainian forces in Eastern Ukraine. There is a word for this.
It was a truly beautiful day in Halland today. But soon I'm taking off for Stockholm again. New duties calling. http://t.co/Aw2CBJaPVl
Red-green opposition parties deeply divided about Sweden signing Host Nation Support Memo with NATO. Bad for them.
Today its Independence Day for Moldova. We congratulate and salute European determination of its government!

Sweden and Finland are working together on Memorandum of Understanding on Host Nation Support with NATO. http://t.co/RsaCWcpPMg
I welcome the Gaza ceasefire agreement. But important that talks on complete lifting of blockade and other issues are not delayed unduly.
EU and its Common Foreign and Security Policy will need strong and serious leadership in the years ahead. Challenges are mounting rapidly.
Rainy day in Stockholm. Hope it’s better in Halmstad later today. But first meeting and discussion with all our Ambassadors.
PM Reinfeldt makes clear that we will look at legal measures to stop individuals joining terrorist and jihadist groups in other countries.
Leaving Gothenburg after interesting and productive day here. Taking the fast train back to Stockholm. http://t.co/1YevHiVATX

Light rain, but still beautiful as I prepare to leave Harpsund after cabinet discussions here. Gothenburg next. http://t.co/HstAHF1ZP3
Today is the day! Слава Україні!
Looks as if the Russian truck convoy was at least as interested in taking things out of Ukraine as in bringing aid in.
Important that Germany Chancellor Merkel now raises the issue of EU help in rebuilding of Donbass region. Will be needed. And expensive.
As usual substantial media attention on our cabinet meeting at Harpsund. http://t.co/paIAwCgn8Y
It’s the Ukraine Flag Day today, with Independence Day coming tomorrow. Congratulations to both!
On my way to PM’s country residence Harpsund for annual informal gathering on primarily economic policy issues. But the world will figure.
Prayer for Ukraine in the old St Sophia Cathedral in Kiev today. http://t.co/SXfHjus4Aj
Today we warmly congratulate Ukraine on its Independence Day. Your independence and territorial integrity important for all of Europe.
Starting day with TV4 Nyhetsmorgon to discuss the state of the world. Numerous grave challenges. Will affect also Sweden.
The biggest story today is not the illegal “aid” convoy from Russia, but the confirmed presence of regular Russian army units in Ukraine.
Old friend Fred Bergsten is theSwedish-American of The Year, and it was a pleasure to see him here. http://t.co/aXmU7n8rBO
Since 2006 this government has increased budget for humanitarian relief from 3 to 5 billion SEK. Here reaching Erbil. http://t.co/MGOILqigcw
It took much too long to get permission from Baghdad, but now Swedish relief flights are arriving in Erbil. http://t.co/zvQxavH6LY
Looks like “aid convoy” now breaking into Ukraine following units of 76th Airborne Division. Full scale attempt to secure key areas.
Sweden decided to give Euro 3,8 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine now.
APC clearly from 76 Airborne Division from Pskov found in Eastern Ukraine. Crack unit of Russia now intervening. http://t.co/BZFfNbk6vC

Time for the first full cabinet meeting after the weeks of summer. Economic and budget issues in focus. But also external ones.
Press briefing with FinMin Anders Borg on a more demanding, even dangerous, external environment in years ahead. http://t.co/GtLvrqoL68
A day with children and displaced people in difficult situation certainly makes deep impression. With @KGeorgievaEU http://t.co/9acdf7C2WY
Wheels up from Erbil with @KGeorgievaEU. Much to report back to other EU governments. We must stay engaged with the people here.
Had time to give interview to @cnni before it’s time to start to prepare to leave this emergency.
Today it’s 11 years since the horrible terrorist attack against UN Hq in Baghdad. We remember and honour those who lost their lives.
Superb work here in Northern Iraq also by @UNIraq, @OCHA, @WFP, @theIRC and many others. But more efforts needed by us all.
As always impressed by work of @ICRC in situation like these. Proud that we are helping to finance their life-saving work.
Important meeting with KRG President Barzani on all the challenges. He was very grateful for our visit and support. http://t.co/qI7imoF0eK
Perhaps worst global humanitarian crisis situation since WW2 - Iraq, South Sudan, Central African Republic. Our help needed! @KGeorgievaEU
In Duhok region of KRG there are now 600.000 displaced people - 1/2 arrived last 2 weeks. 130.000 living in schools. 145.000 outside in heat
Early morning in Erbil. Today we will focus on the refugee humanitarian challenge and what Sweden, EU and the world must do to help.
When we landed in Erbil heard that Baghdad authorities have stopped direct humanitarian relief flights to here. Unacceptable. Must change.
From the talks this evening with @KurdistanRegion PM @NBarzani  and the other representatives here. http://t.co/OgqwLhRJYc
Most schools in @KurdistanRegion now used for housing displaced persons. But must be back to school use soon for all children.
Dinner in Erbil with @KurdistanRegion PM @NBarzani. Retaking of Mosul dam from ISIL today seen as a important move. Huge humanitarian needs.
Press conference in Baghdad with Iraq Acting FM Sharistani and @KGeorgievaEU. Focus on political process. http://t.co/s0lWZGNzMB
I always enjoy coming to dynamic Erbil in KRG. One of the oldest cities in the world. But circumstances now are tragic and challenging.
Now we are wheels up from Baghdad after the interesting talks here. 49 degrees. Heading for Erbil and dinner with KRG PM Barzani and others.
Sweden is the 4th largest provider of humanitarian aid in the world today. EU Commission @KGeorgievaEU is number two. Together EU is first.
There are now approximately 1,2 million people that have been displaced in Iraq. Huge humanitarian as well as political challenge.
After the political talks in Bagdhad we will proceed to Erbil to also assess the humanitarian needs in more detail. EU is helping.
We will see Iraq Acting FM Sharistani, President Masum and Parliament Speaker al-Jibouti when we arrive in Baghdad.
On the way to Baghdad and Erbil together with EU humanitarian commissioner @KGeorgievaEU. Bring political  support and humanitarian help.
Soon wheels up from Turku - Åbo in Swedish - after stimulating and wide ranging informal talks between Finnish and Swedish friends.

Start of election campaign. Soon listen to PM Fredrik Reinfeldt on how to continue the success story of Sweden. And on challenges ahead.
Back in Stockholm. Torrential rain. Thunder. Looks like final days of most things.
Soon wheels up from Brussels and the important meeting here. Also had time with @cnni and @cnbcworld interviews on Ukraine and Iraq.
People seem to be desperately fleeing in all directions from so-called People’s Republics in Eastern Ukraine. Gangsterism destroyed economy.
EU sets up a humanitarian air bridge to northern Iraq as part of our response to the grave challenge of the country. Sweden will take part.

Will soon be on @AJEnglish to discuss the challenges facing Iraq in the middle of its profound crisis. Humanitarian, political, security.
So far Russia has sent weapons, tanks and fighters across border into Eastern Ukraine. And produced death, destruction and despair.

Impressed by the work of @ICRC and @PMaurerICRC for their work in and stance on Eastern Ukraine. Help could be channeled through them.
Tonight a Russian “humanitarian” attempt to make incursion into Eastern Ukraine was averted. http://t.co/4vaBFCs2y3
Alarming reports of Russia moving towards “humanitarian” intervention in Eastern Ukraine. Precursor to full-scale intervention. Grave.
If @PrimeMinisterGE does not want to listen to the best friends of his country in EU that’s his choice. We take note. @LinkeviciusL
It is of course key that US and other activities in Iraq are undertaken only at the request of the authorities in Baghdad.
ISIL’s acts of terror against the Yazidis and other minorities bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide.
I welcome all help to Mount Sinjar as  well as US readiness for air strikes against ISIL.  By all coordinated political strategy needed.
Will be with @richardquest on @CNN at 2200CET tonight. On Russia strange food sanctions against itself.
I welcome urgent meeting by UN Security Council on political, humanitarian and human rights crisis in Iraq. @UNIraq

President Putin has decided that Russia's consumers should have more expensive and less quality food. Great idea...?? http://t.co/6uyqfK0loU
The terror of ISIL must be sharply condemned by everyone. And we must search for ways to stop it and help people. http://t.co/uK29lHSLe3

I salute Germany for cancelling important defence training facility contract with Russia. An example also for others, one might add.
When Russia speaks of “humanitarian mission” in Ukraine there is reason to be suspicious. Too many battalion battle groups assembled.

It's the 4th of August 2014. And there is a war raging in Europe. http://t.co/mivXSAJTlR
Rising conflict and death toll between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh adds to an already most volatile security environment.
The day a century ago when the lights went out all over Europe - and were not lit up again until 1989. A day to remember and to reflect on.
It is appalling to see IDF shelling against or close to the one @UNRWA school after the other in Gaza. http://t.co/ATYcZwIxBZ
A much deeper but by no means easy dialogue with Turkey must be high on the EU list of priorities. Worth reading. http://t.co/DUbPYYBgwN

Росія скасовує режим вільної торгівлі з Молдовою і готується зробити це і з Україною. Очевидно загострення економічної війни.
Россия отменяет свободную торговлю с Молдавией и готовится поступить так и с Украиной. Очевидно обострение экономической войны
Russia is revoking free trade with Moldova and preparing to do the same also with Ukraine. Its economic warfare is obviously escalating.
Fourth: Gaza must become the window of Palestine to the Mediterranean and its port to the world. Secured links with the West Bank built.
Third: Gaza governance must be part of Palestine. PA responsible for security and demilitarisation. Free, fair and open elections.
Second: Israel security must be protected. International mechanism on Gaza boundaries to stop weapons etc. And assure movement and access.
First: Blockade must end. It has fuelled the Hamas tunnel economy and destroyed honest living by honest people. Counterproductive and wrong.
In Swedish earlier today I outlined the four principles fundamental for sustainable Gaza solution.  http://t.co/0iwjVzWVNM
Warmly welcome 72 hr Gaza ceasefire. But must lead to broader political solution. I outlined four principles earlier. http://t.co/VWPrYQvBOI
Good piece from @ecfr on all the possible global consequences of the Ukraine crisis. http://t.co/6jltdYHHWJ
Sweden has now renominated @MalmstromEU as EU Commissioner. Done splendid job on difficult portfolio. An asset to EU and the Commission.
Turning points in Russia? Perhaps first 2003 with Khodorkovsky case. And 2012 with regime reaction to Bolotnaya  demonstrations. Others?
We have reached a turning point in relations btw Russia and the West. This is not what we wished two decades ago. But Russia turned away.

There is every reason to be deeply concerned over the consequences of chaos in Libya. Adds to the exposure of Europe in several respects.
Talked to Norway FM @borgebrende on Middle East and Gaza situation as well as terror threats  against Norway now.
There will now be an EU ban of both trade with and investments in occupied Crimea and Sevastopol. Hope US and others will follow.

I salute US SecState John Kerry for his efforts to achieve ceasefire and solution over Gaza fighting. He has our support.
Israel decision to reject ceasefire highly regrettably. But efforts to stop rockets, bombs and blockade must continue. Killing must stop.
Congratulations to @jokowi_do2 and to Indonesia for a well-conducted election, securing peace and development in the region.

Hope that Russia would de-escalate after MH17 tragedy and crime seems to have been blown out of the sky. Heavy arms flow said to continue.
We’ll, not long ago a Putin advisor talked publicly about actively establishing “no fly zone” over Eastern Ukraine. Aggression continues.
Of course the MH17 tragedy and crime dominates our EU-ASEAN meeting as it gets underway. http://t.co/oqjBsx63jW
Took the occasion of seeing new UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond before start of the rest of today's meetings. http://t.co/ZVpDqbHS5z
Another Brussels day. But it could be far worse than starting with breakfast with @MalmstromEU. Certainly much to talk about these days.
Yes, I think Europe has now woken up. It's different after MH17. http://t.co/G1opKTunMQ
It is alarming when major also European airlines are suspending flights to Tel Aviv out of fear of rocket attacks. These must stop.
A day of constant meeting in Council building in Brussels. But progress on policy on all issues under consideration. http://t.co/RyJXeCyOwM
In discussions this afternoon, all Eastern Partnership countries are looking forward to the next summit in Riga in less than a year.
Now EU FM’s and FM from the Eastern Partnership countries will listen to assessment of Ukraine FM @PavloKlimkin.
We are appalled  by the human cost of the Israeli military operation in Shuja’iyya. And condemn the loss of hundreds of civilian lives.
Deep sorrow, but also increasing anger, characterised today’s EU FM’s meeting after the tragedy and crime of MH17.

Starting my Brussels day with breakfast with my @EPP FM colleagues. And then another coordinating breakfast with Nordic and Baltic FM’s.
I see that Russia MoD now implies that a Ukraine Su25 shot down MH17. That’s a number of bridges too far in terms of credibility.
Correction: September 1983 KAL007 press conference in Moscow was by Soviet CGS Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov.
Landed in Brussels on this National Day of Belgium. Congratulations!
There are those who remember press conference where Soviet Ministry of Defence denied everything concerning shooting down of KAL007.
Soon wheels up for Brussels and two days of meetings there. EU FM’s tomorrow with Russia/MH17/Ukraine and Gaza in obvious focus.
Our staff in Jerusalem and Amman were able to help a further 31 Swedish citizens to leave Gaza.
Started this day with interview with @CNBCWorld on Russia destabilisation policies against Ukraine.

And where is now the SA11 system that most likely shot down MH17? Still where it was? Or withdrawn to Russia? Critical question.
Today Georgia ratified Association and DCFTA agreement with EU, and provisional implementation will start September 1st. Congratulations!
Those responsible, directly and indirectly, for the shooting down of MH17 must be identified, apprehended and brought to justice.

There is no sustainable solution to the Gaza crisis without allowing free access to and from the enclave for all peaceful goods and people.
Also Hamas must now urgently agree to a mutual ceasefire. Israel ground incursion into Gaza will only bring further suffering.

There have been signs of Russia supplying separatist also with fairly advanced surface-to-air systems recently. Horrible.
Absolutely horrible with Malaysia airlines probably shot down over separatist area of Eastern Ukraine. Follows downing of Ukraine aircraft.
Whatever else we might think, Turkey PM Erdoğan is taking significant steps in key Kurdish peace process.  http://t.co/LFAt0CjVcz
Russia is evidently preparing to escalate economic warfare against Moldova and other countries with EU Agreements. http://t.co/irHtCZERHQ
In addition to new sanctions against Russia EU will now also take measures to restrict any investments in Crimea. http://t.co/sSS3gSiQjo
US substantially adds to its sanctions against Russia. Rosneft is a noticeable addition to the list. http://t.co/vldcQjeoTw

I see that @JunckerEU in his program yesterday called for next EU High Representative to be “a strong and experienced player”.
I’m deeply worried by developments in Libya. Profoundly affecting the security also of EU. Both UN and EU must focus on what can be done.
Russia Deputy PM @DRogozin claims that  “every stone, every square metre of land soaked with Russian blood is ours”.  We need to take note.
There is little doubt that Russia is now sending heavy weapons and men into separatist held area of Ukraine. EU must react strongly.
Congratulations to @JunckerEU for election as a Commission President. Good that he puts the digital single market very high on his agenda.
Amazing things you can find in the local stores in Donetsk these days. Or are they possibly from somewhere else... http://t.co/LDrAnhXKjJ
It is wrong to close the door to any new EU members next five years. If Iceland changes its mind again we should have an open door to them.
In his speech @JunckerEU was right in recalling the horrors of a Europe within a Euro. The common currency does protect us from that.
I will truly miss @WilliamJHague as a competent, experienced and credible voice among us EU FM’s. This is a time when experience is needed.

I have to confess that this is thrilling. And I’m in favour of Germany. Let’s hope.
With international attention elsewhere numerous signs that Russian destabilising activities in easternmost Ukraine are escalating.
UN reports that 70% of Palestinian fatalities since 7 July (89) have been civilians, of whom 30% (27) are children. http://t.co/NfBEPPS6QG
As we strongly urge an immediate cease-fire in the conflict we are doing our utmost to help Swedish citizens to leave Gaza.
Preview of my @CNN interview with @FareedZakaria on Ukraine which will air in full later today. http://t.co/UPTvkY5Fqh
Disturbing and grave reports of regular Russian forces entering parts of Ukraine territory. Must be verified. Would be serious escalation.

Western Balkans have high unemployment and low new job creation. Requires structural reforms. Risk of many new Tuzla’s otherwise. #CF2014
Labour force participation in Western Balkans is 46%. In EU it’s 64% and that’s considered too low. Much to do for us all! #CF2014
Of course completely out of the question with Russia veto on EU relations with Ukraine. But revealing attempt. http://t.co/3Dg1NHmL12
EU strengthens sanctions over situation over situation in Eastern Ukraine.  http://t.co/Y2Wr7H7O1M
Countries in Western Balkans must focus on structural reforms. High unemployment. Low job creation. Low labour force participation. #CF2014
Also worrying that statements by Jean Claude Juncker have been very cool on enlargement as task for next five years. #CF2014
Worrying that enlargement doesn’t figure at all in the Strategic Agenda for next years adopted by the European Council at its June meeting.
EU integration focus of discussions here in Dubrovnik. Key for driving reforms and securing democracy. #CF2014 http://t.co/Mu9QE8j8KY
We urge a rapid ceasefire between Israel and the Palestine groups. No one winning. Innocent civilians on both sides are suffering.
My trip from Washington via Frankfurt, Split, Zagreb and an abundance of confusion has now, actually, brought me to Dubrovnik. #CF2014
Latest news: perhaps heading back towards Dubrovnik. Or somewhere else. Life is a circus. #CF2014
Drama continues. Now Croatia Airlines says that they just must change crew. Very nice of them to take us all on this ride… #CF2014
Got worse! After taking off from Split, Croatia Airlines just turns and takes us to Zagreb. Not particularly decent behaviour. #CF2014
Well, I was supposed to go to Dubrovnik and #CF2014, but suddenly find myself at Split airport instead. This remains a region of surprises.
Nearly 500 persons have been killed as a result of pro-Russian armed action in Easternmost Ukraine. Should be unacceptable  in our Europe.

And now wheels up from Kiev. Heading home after timely and forward-looking Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine journey after signing EU agreements.
Long and constructive talk with Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko. We agreed on the need for a mutual and monitored ceasefire in the East.
Separatists in parts of regions of Eastern Ukraine are now holding app 190 hostages. Reports also today of new hostages taken.
Large numbers of heavy weapons have entered Eastern Ukraine from Russia. Clearly incompatible with European and international norms and laws
During its ceasefire Ukraine lost 31 soldiers since separatist in the East never accepted it. New ceasefire must be mutual and monitored.
Lovely summer weather in delightful Kiev. The golden domes of the Lavra by the Dnjepr. http://t.co/NTVSyTvC1X

Soon about to leave Tbilisi and Georgia. But media here this morning reflects the good day of talks we had yesterday. http://t.co/eaF2bDsIh0
I’m truly saddened by the news that the three kidnapped Israeli boys have been found murdered. An appalling act.
Talked with Ukraine FM @PavloKlimkin about the situation on Ukraine-Russia border. We will see each other in Kiev tomorrow.
The key demand put by the EU heads of state and government has not been meet.
EU was clear in demanding that there is should be the return to the Ukrainian authorities of three border check points taken by separatist.

Wheels up for Chisinau as first stop on my tour. Moldova has done great with reforms. But the road ahead is challenging. EU is helping.

Is the tide beginning to turn against the separatist in Eastern Ukraine? Small signs are there. But Kiev must pursue with care and wisdom.

Yesterday I visited informally the operations HQ of the ongoing Swedish air and maritime exercise. http://t.co/OBufNxceAk
But starting my day with two discussions in our Parliament. Developments in the Middle East in focus of the questions I will answer.
Later today I will be at Copenhagen University and discuss European challenges a century after 1914. http://t.co/lYKwqpb1cM
Remarkable facts about how Russia TV is using false information in its reporting from Ukraine.  http://t.co/3wvDyog7Lk
Interesting. Is it a myth that sanctions took Iran to the nuclear talks? Yes, other factors more important. http://t.co/AeIUvgy8Aq
Today it’s 70 years since Stalin deported all Crimea Tatars. Russian authorities have forbidden all manifestations. http://t.co/Wlk2EWFwNK
Also Sweden is helping Bosnia and Serbia through the EU Civil Protection to deal with the flood disaster.  http://t.co/WxwbMUujEu

Intense political talks throughout the evening here in Kiev. Tomorrow, among other things, I’ll celebrate Europe Day with PM @Yatsenyuk_AP.
Sunny day in beautiful Kiev. My presence does not go unnoticed by the media here. Emphasis is on political talks. http://t.co/uGfOlcGf6B
Important UN human rights report clearly refutes Russian propaganda - and rise serious concerns on Crimea. http://t.co/cx3J23Vbgq
The old Swedish church in Gammalsvenskby now used by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as well. We had a very good talk. http://t.co/6NFaz5r2fp
Det blev en fin stund inte minst med de många minnen som de äldre damerna i Gammalsvenskby kunde berätta. http://t.co/f6SH2jy6T4
Landed in Kiev for political talks here today and tomorrow. Support for Ukraine as it moves towards presidential election May 25.
The old Swedish village in Southern Ukraine still here. Moved from Estonia in late 18th century. Tragic history. http://t.co/2c8NQXHizO
Sweden is worried by the semi-hostile takeover bid by Pfizer against AstraZeneca. Important industry for our country. http://t.co/DyJQvnrn1D
Morning by the mighty Dnjepr. Heading to the old Swedish settlement here. From a modern Swedish investment. http://t.co/5PebBNMeSf
Europe will never recognise illegal Russia annexation of Crimea. Intl  law clear: state integrity must be respected. http://t.co/JhCMB2TD5R
I was sorry to hear that former Belgium PM Jean-Luc Dehaene has passed away. He helped us much in our EU negotiations in the early 90’s.
Today we also had time for a quick visit to where the new checkpoints versus Crimea under Russia occupation are. http://t.co/OiC9GpsN0G
Had lively discussions with local representatives and business in Kakhovka on prospects and problems ahead. http://t.co/fWxoF2BUU0

Roughly a thousand refugees have arrived here. Water channel to Crimea functioning, which is worth noting.
Impressed by enormous agricultural possibilities in Southern Ukraine. Now in Kherson region within sight of a Crimea. Visited also @UNHCR.
Completely and utterly false that I have compared Orthodoxy with Islamic terrorism. Propaganda. Beware.  http://t.co/RFgcRQKoz9
Leaving Bratislava and heading for Ukraine. My sixth visit to the country during last eight months. Starting in Kherson in the South.
Sweden will increase defence spending in coming years with more than 10%. Important in more uncertain European situation.
Four PM’s from the Visegrad countries at debate here at #globsec stress importance of stronger EU foreign, security and energy policies.
To strengthen our defence forces, Parliamentary Commission is recommending also acquisition of 10 more advanced version Gripen fighters.
Difficult to avoid noticing great interest also here in Slovakia for potential of the Gripen fighter.
Had good meeting with Czech PM Sobotka on links between our two countries. Stressed importance  also of Gripen fighter cooperation.
Well, one does notice that RT more often than not “sends in the clowns”. Part of the propaganda machine method. http://t.co/wAeL8nEbyA
We meet all the time, but I still had a more official bilateral meeting with Slovakia FM @MiroslavLajcak here today. http://t.co/sg6FFguNQo
Opening #globsec2014 Slovak FM @MiroslavLajcak said that  “we live in far more dangerous neighbourhood than we previously thought.”
This quote from me is a complete fake. Propaganda from somewhere. @b92english @b92 http://t.co/LMWlqD1V0n
Good that there is live stream from #globsec discussions here in Bratislava. Ukraine at the moment. http://t.co/kzFWGM3GHo
Together with @EngstrmHillevi I greeted UN SG Ban Ki-moon welcome to Stockholm this morning. http://t.co/MeaXHVHv6h

Will see UN SG Ban Ki-moon tomorrow morning as he arrives in Stockholm. Future of Syria political and humanitarian effort on agenda.
I regret the decision of Lakhdar Brahimi to step down as UN envoy, but express our thanks for efforts he has done to end carnage in Syria.
Today starts in Vienna key session of the talks with Iran on the nuclear question. Not yet there, but crunch time approaches.
Today Ukraine PM @Yatsenyuk_AP heads to Brussels for talks with EU Commission on support and help to Ukraine reforms and democracy.
Should certainly not be forgotten that we also adopted conclusion on EU policy for Arctic region today.   http://t.co/Ma8LAoOjMe
Russia MFA reaction to so called referendum yesterday indicates it continues to pursue destabilisation strategy. http://t.co/ZHC19egMJx
It was a rainy day in Stockholm late summer 2010 that @alexstubb and myself said that Europe needed a @eurpeace. Now it’s reality.
Taking off from Brussels after important EU FM meeting and @eurpeace launch. Was an initiative by then Finland FM @alexstubb and myself 2010
And here eight European governments are officially launching the EIP @Eurpeace. Great interest. http://t.co/DN9UIRHD50

We started our EU meeting today here in Brussels with what we can do to help to #BringBackOurGirls.

Five key contests on the final day of the gigantic and important election in India. http://t.co/pUnxShwptt
Leaving Stockholm very early for a day in Brussels with EU FM’s. Russia/Ukraine and Middle East will be in focus. http://t.co/kTVX91Ze28
In @svtagenda on how the extreme left and the extreme right go hand in hand in seeking to weaken and fragment the EU - a dangerous policy.
Figures from fake referendums in Eastern Ukraine likely to be fake. No way of knowing even turnout.
Rather predictable reactions in parts of Russia to result of #Eurovision yesterday. A fault line in societies. http://t.co/fLrT9KYzUn
European Institute of Peace gets off the ground tomorrow. @Eurpeace. Great success! http://t.co/QqjeSIU1wc
Important that the new peace agreement for South Sudan is respected. There is acute risk of a hunger catastrophe. http://t.co/nVV4IY4PVl
Looking at voting patterns in #Eurovision yesterday. Our bilateral relations with Italy under some strain. But booming with Ukraine.
Turmoil driven by separatists and pro-Russia armed gangs risks completely collapsing the economy of the Donbass region. Tragedy coming.
Presidential election in Lithuania today with @Grybauskaite_LT in strong position for 2nd term. An important neighbour to us.
Can’t stop of reflecting over power consumption of fabulous #Eurovision show. Like couple of steelworks. Guess rest of Denmark in darkness.
Joining app 180 million others and watching the #Eurovision final from Copenhagen. Great show.
Today was last day of Nordic Baltic Transition Support Unit in Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan. Helped build peace. http://t.co/D6b7nSx61i
Крим - це українська територія, окупована Росією. Повинен бути закритий вхід (туди) для будь-якого законного бізнесу, не схваленого Києвом.
Everything possible must be done to #BringBackOurGirls!
Crimea is Ukraine territory occupied by Russia. It must be off-limits to any legitimate business or other activity not approved by Kiev.
I understand new Estonia PM @TaaviRoivas had good visit to Stockholm and PM Fredrik Reinfeldt today. http://t.co/Ywz2qDBq9o
Today 67 million smartphone users in India. At election 5 yrs ago only 2.5 million. Campaigns in worlds largest election also going online.
Even in times like these we should remember that during WW2 the Soviet Union lost 27 million people. Victory Day has a meaning.
Would have been nice to be in Sarajevo for reopening of old National Library. Shelled and burnt out during the war. http://t.co/u5jzqcmonV
Unfortunately starting to head home from Paris on this Europe day. http://t.co/4yb6w7ErY9
Could capital flows out of Russia last few months have been as high as $220bn? ECB seems to think so. Huge. http://t.co/AH9YsNYmLV
Je salue l’action des Européens pour faire avancer la croissance et la solidarité sur notre continent. #EuropeDay
We need the EU for four simple reasons: peace, prosperity, security and stability. Together we can do what we can’t do alone. #EuropeDay
Divisions over history. Yesterday was WW2 victory day here in France. Today is victory day in Russia. And for the US it ended with Japan.
Just spent a lively Paris dinner discussing lessons of 1914 for how to handle the Europe of 2014. Value of a strong EU unanimous conclusion.
I happen to be in Paris and proud to report that a Swede took gold in the annual Bocuse d'Or contest between chefs.  http://t.co/CxroiqcS3Y
Paris. Cloudy and chilly here as well. But good discussion with friends from across Europe and US on China, Afghanistan and other issues.
No support for separatism in Ukraine. But need to develop dialogue between elected representatives in all regions. http://t.co/nerl1gKHF9
Soon taking off for Paris. Informal discussion on wide variety of foreign policy challenges on the agenda there.
Thursday morning. Rainy and chilly. Cabinet meeting. Assess beginning of EU election campaign. Important to raise voter awareness.
Some sort of fake referendum in Eastern Ukraine on May 11 was part of destabilisation plan. Good step if Moscow now ditches it.
Russia FM Lavrov warns against extreme right-wing forces in Europe. But it was these he relied on to support Russia policy on Crimea.
Here my remarks at the @Coe ministerial meeting in Vienna yesterday. http://t.co/SkYL6GN51R
Today we have key parliamentary debate between our party leaders on EU issues prior to May 25 election. I will - of course - be there.
"Regime isolating Russia from the Western world, ending any hope for the country's modernization." http://t.co/p8Nt5qZt2E
Leaving Vienna after @coe meeting dominated by Russia/Ukraine issue. But strong support from nearly all states here for May 25 election.
Ukraine FM @ADeshchytsia makes strong appeal for support to his country's democratic path. http://t.co/cFTnlvNkDG
Russia sometimes sounds as if it’s refighting WW2. Fascism all over the place. Enemies everywhere. Ghosts of history mobilised.
I also highlighted the @ceo report on human rights in Ukraine which focuses on concern for the situation of the Crimea Tatars now.
And I called for all @coe states to support the holding of the presidential elections in Ukraine on May 25. Democracy is the solution.
In @coe speech I underlined gravity of Russia’s violation of core commitment by occupation and annexation of Crimea. Must never be accepted.
No reason to complain about the setting of our @coe meeting in the old Hofburg. Now new Serbia FM Dacic speaking. http://t.co/aMCdamsr28
Ukraine issue obvious on the streets of Vienna before start of our @coe ministerial here. http://t.co/XVmwJo2z9i
Would have loved to see this exhibition here in Vienna on aspects of 1914. But 2014 crisis takes all my time. http://t.co/MMwULPPGvv
Dinner also with Austria FM @sebastiankurz. Has handled @coe chairmanship during these difficult six months very well.
Most enjoyable and important dinner celebrating 65 years of @coe. But what will happen tomorrow? Acute tensions with and over Russia.
On my way to @coe ministerial in Vienna. Celebrate 65 years of work for rights and democracy tonight. But Russia aggression will dominate.
Most enjoyable discussion on challenges for Europe with also @birgittaohlsson at @ufstockholm earlier today! http://t.co/fjl0widcFt
I hope our relations with Kazakhstan in political and economic fields will expand in coming years. Great potential. http://t.co/FbwejhgQ9L
Sweden and Ethiopia has a long history of cooperation. Important to build on in new era. http://t.co/ioM31yriJR
Will today receive new ambassadors from Kazakhstan and Ethiopia. Both countries just opened or reopened embassies here in Stockholm.
Djemilev - leader of the Crimean Tatars - was again denied entry to his homeland by Russian authorities. A shame. http://t.co/6pq6D3oAuF
Full day of campaigning for EU election in Stockholm and Malmö yesterday. Interest growing. Ukraine crisis brings key issues in focus.
I welcome release of illegally detained @OSCE inspectors in Ukraine. All other hostages held by illegal armed groups should be released.
PM Fredrik Reinfeldt stresses need for a strong EU to help ensure stability and peace in all of Europe. http://t.co/uiBAvvfyeB

Винні у смертях у Одесі повинні постати перед судом, а мир і спокій відновлено у цьому прекрасному місті. #UnitedForUkraine
Виновных в смертях в Одессе следует отдать под суд, а мир и покой - восстановить в этом красивом городе. #UnitedForUkraine
Those responsible for all the deaths in Odessa must be brought to justice, and peace and calm restored to this beautiful city.
Horrible with at least 38 dead in Odessa. Seems to have started with pro-Russian attempt to get control of buildings. Violence must stop!
Hectic evening. First on @AlJazeera discussing developments in Ukraine and then on @CNN on the same subject and the issue of sanctions.
Pro-Russian thugs getting active and violent in Odessa as well. Unfortunately not unexpected. But Odessa is a city open to all of Europe.
Strong support by US President Obama and Germany Chancellor Merkel for Ukraine elections May 25. Disruptions should not be tolerated.
So far clear assessment is that Kiev government has been implementing April 17 Geneva agreement while Russia has not.
I guess the new US report on big data is mandatory reading for all concerned with the new issues of the new world.  http://t.co/lIsyeEu7QT
Ukrainian helicopters shoot down in Slovyansk. Some elderly ladies bought some RPG’s or missiles at the local grocery store, I assume.
Slightly late, but I should congratulate Ivica Dačić on becoming new FM of Serbia. EU accession talks core of his mission in coming years.
Every EU enlargement has been opposed by some fearing it would weaken us. Each one has afterwards been seen as strengthening the EU.
We need an even stronger, broader and deeper European Union to meet the regional as well as global challenges ahead.
Ukraine unveils deep economic reform program backed by large IMF loan and support. To turn the country around. http://t.co/95vNIae7vK

Taking off to Iceland and meeting there tonight with Nordic FM’s. Dinner at Reykholt of Snorre Sturlason fame.

Soon taking off for Tallinn - other capital closest to Stockholm. Looking forward to #lennartmeri conference. Ukraine on agenda tonight.
Not even the most minute sign of Moscow trying to get illegal gangs in Eastern Ukraine to follow Geneva agreement. None. Nada. Nichts.

Spent Easter Day in the sun in Ferrara in Northern Italy. A true gem of the renaissance. http://t.co/rHYjGhCczx
Talked with Ukraine FM @AndriiDesh on moving implementation of Geneva agreement forward. Visible progress on the ground needed.
Good preparations for global  @netmundial2014 in São Paulo next week on the future of Internet governance.  http://t.co/0AlxyJL71r
I wish all the relevant parts of my followers here a Happy Easter!
I’m very concerned with attacks in both Bor and Bentiu in South Sudan against innocent civilians and also a UN base. Reports of many killed.
Lage pro-Ukraine rally in Donetsk yesterday. Reports say it was larger than pro-Russian ones. But without automatic weapons. A difference.
Enemies of freedom are seeking to work together to control and censor the net. Free nations must counter.  http://t.co/75a2j9Datz
After Geneva talks today key whether Russia delivers on calling on green men and others to leave occupied buildings in Donbass.
I see that President Putin has now acknowledged that regular Russian forces were “behind” so called local forces on Crimea.
Today is a key day in India’s great and important parliamentary election. Result matter to the world. http://t.co/MNLPotnqLp
Impressive picture from pro-Ukraine manifestation in Odessa. http://t.co/dhabx64rs1
Sounds as if President Putin is now extending ambitions to what he refers to as Novorossija covering all South and East of Ukraine.
Beautiful day in the clear and bright sun of northern Italy today. But events elsewhere dominate. http://t.co/jVPhwFD9pr
Obvious that Moscow supports illegal armed groups and aims at creating a fragmented and dysfunctional Ukraine. http://t.co/vIQcR6ok9u
I am concerned that two presidential candidates have been harassed and abused in Ukraine today. The election must be protected.
UN human rights report refutes Russian propaganda allegations on Ukraine. http://t.co/LZisoCWLeJ
Easter is approaching so I’m hoping for a few more relaxed days. Whether events will permit it will remain an open question.
And now we are wheels up from Luxembourg and heading home to Stockholm. Strong EU position on Russia and Ukraine agreed today.
EU calls for Russia to immediately withdraw mandate of its Federation Council to use force against Ukraine. Important for upcoming talks.
Important statement by Donetsk key industrialist Ahmetov on the need for Ukraine as a unified and united country. 

 http://t.co/TrBApxXRew
Today we also approved up to €1bn in macro-financial assistance to Ukraine following IMF package. http://t.co/V4J9ox5NEH
Here my remarks to media on Russia and Ukraine as I arrived at the EU meeting here in Luxembourg today.  http://t.co/mfFHhJqL2I
Started EU meeting with formal decision on unilateral trade opening for Ukraine. An immediate boost of €500 million for Ukraine business.
And my third preparatory meeting today is with my Nordic and Baltic FM colleagues. Always most useful.
Good today that there is time also for meeting with @EPP FM’s before we start the formal EU meeting.
Starting day with meeting @ecfr and listening to their observations on Russia and Ukraine. Independent analysis always worth listening to.
Luxembourg a Sunday evening. Not overly lively. Ended up at a restaurant where I counted five EU FM’s. The rest are probably at home.
If illegal armed groups took over police stations and local government offices in Sweden we would use all our instruments to restore order.
Sweden wants a stronger financial IMF support package for Ukraine coupled with clear reforms. http://t.co/MSX6UtVvlX
Spoke also to FM @AndriiDesh before leaving Ukraine. Expressed support for efforts of Ukraine government to protect democracy.
Clear that Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani will go to second round in Afghanistan presidential election. http://t.co/VHVUCHQ5vS
Wheels up from Odessa after most useful time spent here. Charming and important Ukraine city. Now for Luxembourg prior to EU FM’s tomorrow.
EU’s Ashton urges Russia to pull back forces from border and cease any further action aimed at destabilising Ukraine. http://t.co/L7gsfYHW3X
Pleasant atmosphere here in Odessa - but people are genuinely concerned and afraid of what might happen. http://t.co/nbUmHBfyFL
Here a nice group photo of the nice local activists of Eastern Ukraine. All with identical automatic weapons. http://t.co/DSY4SQrBIr
Ukraine unity supporters gathered this morning again at Potemkin stairs in Odessa. People are extremely worried. http://t.co/d3S161LKD9
We must also demand that Russia immediately revokes Federation Council mandate of March 1 for armed invasion of Ukraine.
Also Russia must demand that illegally armed groups in Ukraine immediately disarm, leave occupied buildings and respect democratic order.
It was a coordinated armed action to seize control over key parts of Eastern Ukraine yesterday. Would not have happened without Russia.
Coordinated action by well armed and equipped units at key locations in Eastern Ukraine. Massive escalation of destabilisation strategy.
This was at the famous stairs of Odessa earlier today. Support for a European Ukraine. http://t.co/pX4F2CD6dz
Change of plans. Will obviously remain in Odessa overnight. Alarming developments in Eastern Ukraine. Green men.
"Moscow must stop dictating terms to Kyiv and cancel Federation Council decision on army against Ukraine". http://t.co/qELmpG3H5A
Seems as Transnistria imported 8 billion cigarettes last year. Extremely heavy smokers. Or something else…
Highly stimulating discussion with large number of young entrepreneurs and civil society activists in Odessa. A dynamic city.
Among other problems Odessa now also has to deal with to date app. 1.500 refugees from Crimea after the Russian occupation and annexation.
In Odessa I also look forward to visiting the EUBAM mission monitoring the border to Moldova.  http://t.co/CZzUKrAWHR
Now I’m leaving Kiev and heading for Odessa in Southern Ukraine for wide-ranging talks there. Later today I continue to Kherson.
Starting my day with working breakfast with Ukraine FM @AndriiDesh. We have much to discuss.
Here with translation into Ukrainian is my speech and Q &amp; A with students in Kiev earlier today. http://t.co/xkJnJ3ebZU
The popularity of selfies seems to be as solid here in Ukraine as elsewhere. A lot of them during the day. http://t.co/w1lOTdHLaZ
Will soon be live on Shuster Live here in Ukraine. One of the most TV shows here. http://t.co/u0ZuKyDkbE
Also very good discussions at the Kyiv Security Forum. Respect for territorial integrity key to stability of Europe. http://t.co/jEZ5DfxSL3
Also my meeting with Yulia Tymoshenko attracted a lot of media attention. http://t.co/gHhT8UvA3y
Certainly a full, interested and enthusiastic house as I spoke at the Institute of Journalism here in Kiev. http://t.co/KnbChewVkB
Ukraine is the centre of Europe’s and the worlds attention now. This is my fifth visit within the last seven months. Talk to everyone.
If Ukraine improved its energy efficiency to reasonably EU levels I doubt it would need to import any gas at all.
Was great to see Yulia Tymoshenko again and discuss the future of Ukraine with her as well.
Ended this day in Kiev with productive dinner with presidential candidate Petro Poroshenko and Slovakia FM @MiroslavLajcak. Much to discuss.
Missed Kyiv Security Forum today because of other talks here, but will certainly be there tomorrow morning. http://t.co/dBpVB024W7
Talks with PM Yatsenyuk on what we can do more to support independence, integrity and reforms of Ukraine. http://t.co/uEijPCLttV
Off to Ukraine to see PM @Yatsenyuk_AP and attending Kyiv Security Forum this evening. Together with also Slovak FM @MiroslavLajcak.
Sign with @LinkeviciusL treaty on boundary in the Baltic Sea between Swedish and Lithuanian economic zones. http://t.co/QgLe8LVK99
Now we are answering questions in Parliament. Here our Minister for Labour Market Elisabeth Svantesson. http://t.co/NwMbfmbFwv
It was really a group of eminent persons we could welcome for the  @ctbto_alerts nuclear disarmament discussions. http://t.co/pGDv1hbyje
EU, Swedish, Italian and Lithuanian flags outside our Ministry today. http://t.co/xESNAMD40d
Destabilisation efforts continue. Russia nearly doubles gas price for Ukraine and demands one month advance payment. Crisis within crisis.
Will meet Group of Eminent Persons of @ctbto_alerts to discuss issues of nuclear disarmament. Complete Test Ban Treaty key part of efforts.
Thursday. Cabinet meeting. I stand in for several colleagues in decisions today. And always important to sum up issues and events.
Is a pleasure to have Italy FM @FedericaMog here. First time for an Italian FM in Sweden since 1996. http://t.co/CYNI8BVShK
Very pleased to welcome Italy FM @FedericaMog to Stockholm for bilateral talks this evening. Weather could have been better…
Excellent that Commission with 
@StefanFuleEU is now setting up Support Group to coordinate efforts for Ukraine.    http://t.co/oeuFvc5MKA
A pleasure to talk with Canada FM @HonJohnBaird on Ukraine, Arctic cooperation and other issues. Weather better in Ottawa than here.
Slightly bizarre with @BBCWorld live coverage of some tragic trial in South Africa. Is that what's most important in our world today?
Mobile data use in Africa increases by 119% a year. A dynamic continent and a revolutionary technology. http://t.co/DiNxIIDN5c
Russia is inviting pure ridicule in criticising Ukraine for military preparations. Russia has invaded Crimea and massed troops on borders.
Important parliamentary and local elections in Indonesia today. Race for 560 seats in parliament and some 19,000 across the country.
US says that Russia special forces and agents have been involved in Eastern Ukraine during last 24 hours. Then we are seeing new escalation.
Back in Stockholm. Looks like November has come back. Pretty depressing weather.
New report by the Independent Commission on Turkey was launched yesterday. I will read it with interest. http://t.co/paChgisEvu
"Moscow's strategy is to weaken Ukraine's government institutions as much as possible." http://t.co/xZE2A88N1X
Dubai still in darkness. Off to get flight back to Stockholm.
May will be a critical month in Russian strategy to destabilise Ukraine with focus now in South and East. Note May 9, May 11 and May 25.
Today is the start of the world's largest democratic election - India begins to vote for its parliament Lok Sabha. http://t.co/I98Kwuu1qd
The sun is setting over Kabul airport as I wait for my delayed flight. It's a long journey back home. http://t.co/AEAHANcIPH
Soon leaving Kabul after day with many but overwhelmingly positive talks and impressions. Afghanistan now seems to be on the right track.
Also had a press conference earlier today with Afghanistan FM Osmani. Focus on good bilateral relationship. http://t.co/McaxmmFfdq
Enjoyable conversation as always with Abdullah Abdullah. Confident about good election result. http://t.co/z22pD6i7RT
Most enjoyable garden chat with Ashraf Ghani on task awaiting Afghanistan after the successful election. http://t.co/XTok5VSENT
Landed in a sunny Kabul. Optimistic mood after polling day. Started by seeing key international representatives. http://t.co/xlRU1MYHA2
Leaving Istanbul after day of work - but also some leisure with the sights of the city. Its Sunday, after all. Now off to new challenges.
Visit to Haga Sophia always impresses. It took a thousand years until anything that could rival it was built. http://t.co/7t4i4vAPD7
Sunday pattern that pro-Russian thugs try to stir up trouble in Eastern Ukraine. Heavily supported by Kremlin propaganda machine. And more.
Most readable from always good @aanafgh on the details of yesterday's historic election in Afghanistan. http://t.co/51jDhO7nIG
Yes, you have to ask yourself, what else is in President Putins's  heart?  http://t.co/wJPqCahjYu
It's another society, but this photo of Afghan women lining up to vote is still a picture of a society changing. http://t.co/EqPC82GNXP
Delightful, constructive and insightful dinner by the Bosphorus with different Turkish intellectuals. http://t.co/8wDFYLFU10
I warmly congratulate the people of Afghanistan to the success of this day of voting. We will see who won, but very clear that Taliban lost.
Today it's 50 days to the election to European Parliament. Most important for coming five years. Time to start mobilising.
As usual keen media interest in what we had discussed. But meetings like these are not for decisions. http://t.co/Vcu8pLgNiQ
Leaving Athens after very good meeting here. Truly important with informal meetings like these. Reflect on bigger issues. Now to Istanbul.
Discussing EU strategic partnerships. But good question also if others see us as sufficiently capable of being a true strategic partner.
If you are interested in Eastern Partnership, the seminar we had in Riga on the subject is now available on the web. http://t.co/AGIRTWfChU
Important to be able to follow @afghansvote during this very important day. Reports so far of big turnout throughout Afghanistan.
This morning we are joined in our discussions by ministers from the candidate countries. Balkans and Turkey. http://t.co/knB0yiq7i0
Today is - most important - first round of presidential elections in Afganistan. Crucial for future of the country. http://t.co/4AT8T8SU9N
Our day of informal talks. Here Germany FM Steinmeier, Croatia FM @vpusic, Cathy Ashton and myself earlier. http://t.co/WV30SZeYlB
Wonderful dinner in wonderful Acropolis museum. Everyone should visit. But serious discussion on EU challenges.   http://t.co/CvuNMbnyxA
Getting worried by developments in Georgia. Government's politics of revenge is not congruent with a free and fair election environment.
Sorry to miss #sverigemotet back in Sweden, with also MEP candidates, but EU discussions must be my priority today. http://t.co/9kKWK0F4Nn
Truly beautiful day in Athens as we start our crucial informal talks about EU Firesign policy challenges ahead. http://t.co/Kfy9ljWKXl
Arrived in pleasant Athens, and happy to note that Greece "is set to emerge from a six-year recession this year." .http://t.co/f9r82OwrsM
And here I am in Istanbul - changing flights to Athens - enjoying that Twitter is back in Turkey. A rather shameful episode for the country.
Breakfast in Brussels and day in Stockholm. Now off for Istanbul to get to Athens late tonight. Informal EU FM meeting there tomorrow.
Beautiful picture of polling material being distributed in Afghanistan prior to crucial election this weekend. http://t.co/xx44yRN2xs

No less than 61 heads of state and government at our EU-Africa summit. Discussion now moved to business links. http://t.co/SgPR0TA6NH
It is sometimes useful to be reminded of how large Africa is. Rising billion there key partnership for Europe. http://t.co/FPhojSg5Wz
Slight turmoil, but the vast summit between EU and African nations is slowly getting going. http://t.co/WDpeRAC61O
But I also said that we have failed with drug issue in Afghanistan. Production increasing. This corrupts and corrodes the entire society.
At ISAF meeting, I said that Sweden gives 1% of our GDP as ODA, and single biggest receiving country in the years ahead will be Afghanistan.
Always useful meetings in the corridors of NATO. Here with John Kerry from US and @martinlidegaard from Denmark. http://t.co/MZ1dfrVRfV
Early bird to Brussels for meetings today. ISAF ministerial on Afghanistan and Summit between EU and Africa thereafter. And Ukraine.
Even Belarus FM defends Ukraine's right to choose its "integration vector". No applause in Moscow for that. http://t.co/f1QS5XJzl7
This statement by Russia on territorial integrity of Ukraine should be nominated for some prize. Only uncertain which http://t.co/ESb1eCO5Gi
We very much welcome the opening of the Embassy of Afghanistan to Sweden today. We are committed to helping Afghanistan in the years ahead.
At @uacrisis briefing in Kiev @engstrmhillevi presented our Swedish direct support to Ukraine. https://t.co/NYNnaCBTi6
EU launches military operation for Central African Republic. Humanitarian emergency. Sweden helps with air transport. http://t.co/1jywIs4UdF
Our minister @EngstrmHillevi is in Kiev today to discuss our different assistance program's for Ukraine. #UnitedForUkraine
Soon to Parliament to discuss the situation in Syria and in particular the plight of the Christian and Kurdish communities there.
Until Federation Council of Russia annuls its authorisation to invade Ukraine the threat of it happening is there. It must be withdrawn.
Today was also the important Summit meeting between EU and China in Brussels. Should not be forgotten. http://t.co/2RBxJ2jrCJ

Looks like being a most interesting presidential election in Afghanistan this weekend. Likely to be a second round. http://t.co/OTiQ0FOnmS
Off early this morning to get to Växjö and Jönköping. To discuss how Europe could cope better with all our regional and global challenges.
Will soon be with @FareedZakaria on @CNN to discuss latest development in Russia policy against Ukraine. http://t.co/2ePnSVwkZq
Detailed material on responsibility for the killings in Kiev on February 20. Yanukovich crack forces. http://t.co/2eZsffYudW
Highly charged Turkish local elections today. Battle for Istanbul is of even more importance than usual. But also local elections in France.
Enthusiastic women at @ashrafghani election rally in Herat today. A good sign. http://t.co/ANEMKVLw74
In this phase of crisis, Kremlin seeks a pact with the West to get acceptance for its scheme for Ukraine. A certain historical pattern here.
Russia uses fake claims to significantly increase economic pressure on Ukraine. Destabilisation strategy. http://t.co/lJvQ1EdrGo
Kremlin plan to break up Ukraine in units that could go off in different directions will create instability and disorder for decades.
Greater unity among pro-European forces prior to May Ukraine election is most welcome. Fragmentation of country is still a major risk.
Taliban is doing what they can to disrupt the election in Afghanistan. A sign of weakness. Democratic choice makes the country stronger.
Over one million people have been forced from their homes by the conflict in South Sudan. No end in sight. http://t.co/5EaBYptVFo
There is also good news from Afghanistan. Election campaign intense. Impressive rallies. Lively debates. http://t.co/2iOS2hd2Sp
I'm worried for situation of Crimea Tatars. Reports of hundred of refugees. Important that @osce and @AstridThors urgently look at issue.
I have no doubt @jensstoltenberg is a good choice as new SG of @nato. Intimate knowledge also of Northern European security issues a plus.
Now heading home after a most successful state visit in Latvia. A close relationship is now even closer. http://t.co/HPxDjavmqn

Excellent @NSS2014 dinner. PM Reinfeldt and myself had good talks with, among others, US President Obama and China President Xi Jinping.
Strong political signal to Russia that there will now be a G7 Summit in Brussels in June instead of the planned G8 in Sochi.
Truly grotesque: more than 500 people sentenced to death in a single hearing in Egypt.  Worst seen worldwide. http://t.co/HNL0j5koOY

Perhaps @McFaul underestimating force of Putin's new anti-Western and anti-decadent line. Building on deeply conservative orthodox ideas.
Absolutely worth reading @McFaul reflections on where Russia is now heading. He is not optimistic. http://t.co/Y2AaZDnmjr
Nuclear security key global security issue. Reduce nuclear arms. Secure fissile material. Safe nuclear power to fight climate change.
Soon taking off for @NSS2014 in The Hague. I was there at the previous meetings in Washington and Seoul as well. Great progress achieved.

Morning in Brussels. Somewhat grey. Last day of #BrusselsForum  http://t.co/y1uwyzJeDX
Russia statement that @OSCE Ukraine mission restricted mandate reflecting "new legal realities" not true. It just reflects Russian refusal.
Stupid efforts in Turkey to try to block Twitter isn't working and also backfiring heavily. http://t.co/8nDMhzAMmD
We should note that there is an ongoing concentration of Russian forces along the borders of Ukraine. http://t.co/0J7Mi6z2hZ
Welcome agreement, but with restrictions, on @OSCE monitors in Ukraine. Now must deploy quickly. Disgrace that Russia stop access to Crimea.
Rather disgraceful that the two Russian Ambassadors here left the room when Ukraine FM @AndriiDesh took the stage. #BrusselsForum

Talked with @camanpour on @CNN on impact of measures on Russia and its economy. And on options ahead in Russia aggression crisis.
President Obama's announcement of new measures against Russian persons and interests significant. Cost of aggression should now be clear.

Looks as if Russia has initiated fairly complete trade sanctions against Ukraine. Would be a most serious escalation. http://t.co/SZWT5Onmr0
In morning discussions on @bbcworldservice I stressed priority of helping Ukraine as a stable democracy able to chart its own course.
With the one issue after the other Russia is delaying or blocking  @OSCE mission to Ukraine. We should have been there long time ago.
Cabinet meeting at the start of this day. Ukraine discussion before PM Reinfeldt heads for Brussels and European Council there later today.

President Putin moves fast to take over Crimea also formally.  This confirms his profound challenge to international law and global order.
New round of nuclear talks with Iran FM @JZarif in Vienna today. We clearly need fewer conflicts in our world.
Too early to judge what the Kremlin finally intends to do with Crimea. I guess we will get clearer view tomorrow.
And now we are heading back to Stockholm. Awaiting further developments in the Russia and Ukraine crisis. Ready for additional measures.

Lunch discussion with EU FM's on energy policies. Russian behaviour clearly causing rethink in a number of countries. But change takes time.
OpEd with Denmark FM @martinlidegaard on what Ukraine means for European energy policy. http://t.co/sWXzdbV2Sz
Latest Russia proposal on Ukraine smells somewhat like dream of repetition of February 1945 deals on fate of Poland.
Apart from restrictions on individuals today we are discussing readiness for further measures against Russia if there is no de-escalation.
Started EU FM's meeting now. Was late to Friends of Ukraine meeting because of snow in Stockholm. Ukraine obviously in focus also today.
Slightly new twist to diplomacy with threat to turn US into "radioactive waste". Russian TV propaganda surpassing itself.
Very early wheels up from the sudden snow of Stockholm. First Friends of Ukraine and the EU FM's regular meeting in Brussels today.
EU very clear on illegal and illegitimate so called referendum on Crimea. http://t.co/hvbyKBXwCX
So called referendum in Crimea is irregular and unconstitutional. A political show to give face of legitimacy to Russian military invasion.
I welcome this key step for true internationalisation of Internet. Will facilitate @OurInternetGCIG work. http://t.co/7RL3FoOfV1
Ukraine FM @AndriiDesh already on the way to Brussels. We have Friends of Ukraine meeting there early tomorrow morning. Chart the way ahead.
Important parliamentary election in Serbia today. The country needs a strong commitment to economic reforms and EU accession negotiations.
No viable arguments against EU imposing an arms embargo on Russia. EU already stated that the country has committed an act of aggression.
At UN Security Council 13 nations vote against Crimea so called referendum. China abstains. Russia vetoes. Voice of world is clear.
Impressive pictures from Moscow today. There is another Russia. http://t.co/pejvw4LRtq
More than 9 million people have been forced to flee their homes in three years of Syria conflict. #WithSyria http://t.co/ihlUKQCA4A
Another day. Home in Stockholm. Lengthy interview in @sverigesradioP1 soon. Ukraine crisis in focus. Also Syria three years after war start.
Three years since start of war in Syria. Horrible humanitarian situation. We must commit to ending it. #WatchSyria http://t.co/XvJmqOgCFV
Now we have the so called local defence groups in Crimea also deploying artillery. Clearly Russian forces. http://t.co/38y91YzoH5
Ominous Russia statement after yesterday's events in Donetsk. Also total distortion of what really happened. http://t.co/wxqpWswAO9
There was very broad support for the statement on Russian actions in Ukraine that I delivered in Parliament today. http://t.co/Z0MQ6bEHRI
Evidently no progress in talks about Russian actions in Ukraine in London today. So called referendum on Crimea goes ahead.
Will give statement to Parliament on Russia and Ukraine now.
Very worrying with deaths in Donetsk. Pro-Russia thugs very active. Important to avoid any provocation.
Will start my day with EU Committee in Parliament, but at 12:00 I'm giving a statement in Parliament on situation with Russia and Ukraine.
We see that major independent news sites are now being blocked in Russia.
Will see all the EU Ambassadors in Stockholm to discuss our common challenges. Not difficult to guess what will dominate the discussion.
The Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Ukraine counters propaganda statements on anti-semitism wave in Ukraine.     http://t.co/wc9SVqZhnl
Thursday in Stockholm. Sunny and nice. Cabinet meeting. Will brief on Ukraine crisis, Russia aggression and EU efforts.
And here also video of my interview on Ukraine in @cnbcworld yesterday. http://t.co/djALUdPSsO
Here the Channel Four interview in its entirety on Ukraine, UK and Europe. http://t.co/AqaaGqiK2h
In Channel Four interview I warned of weakening Europe in view of what's happening towards our East and our South. http://t.co/ywQIgEvK3a
Now taking off for Stockholm. Briefing cabinet tomorrow morning on Russia and Ukraine. And informing Parliament on the situation on Friday.
Sounds as if Kremlin is questioning the legality of the Belavezha Accords on dissolution of the Soviet Union. If correct truly remarkable.
It was a day also of intense media interest. Here another TV interview in the sun outside the Houses of Parliament. http://t.co/lo9POOq2oW
"Don’t change Ukraine's borders: Swedish minister". http://t.co/lBnVl1E2Aq
Had, as expected, very good talks with @WilliamJHague  in the rather distinguished rooms of the FCO in London. http://t.co/zzfIcD7Tm9
A visit to London must include a visit to @hatchards bookstore. And interview with @monocle 24 radio. Here combined. http://t.co/k9ANWQ0J4P
Fabulous spring weather in London. Daffodils are out in St James's Park. http://t.co/ZjErAAfgZp
Very productive talks at @EBRD with President Chakrabarti and his leadership team. Ukraine again in focus. http://t.co/mqa3llFBfG
European Parliament discusses Ukraine today. Here introduction by @BarossoEU on what Commission is doing. http://t.co/RiYhDIDkQE
Did interview with @louisabojesen of @cnbcworld here in London earlier today. All about Russia and Ukraine. http://t.co/85XMeIgnue
Good on the myths of Moscow's invasion of Crimea. From the Moscow Times. http://t.co/vVGIVbAgJB
Then for a round table with think tanks at @CER_London on Western reaction to Russia's action. And on the future role of Britain in Europe.
Sunny morning in London. Will start the day with giving interviews with @BBCWorld as well as @CNBC on Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
Excellent that EU moves forward fast with unilateral trade provisions for Ukraine. Clear sign of support. http://t.co/dvyiVxTOic
All flights to Crimea from Kiev stopped. Only flights to Moscow allowed. Russia continues to escalate the conflict.
And now off to address a meeting on Sustainable Arctic
Shipping and Marine Operations. Sweden carries on its engagement on Arctic issues.
Lunch in London on the global net issues. Freedom on and of the net. Great interest in work of our @OurInternetGCIG commission.
Had time to briefly pass by the new Viking exhibition at the British Museum. Well worth seeing. New perspectives. https://t.co/5fqdrW9fat
Nils Horner was a very experienced and respected journalist. I valued him highly. The killing of him today in Kabul is a true tragedy.
These days it's actually 25 years since the web was born. A true revolution in our age. http://t.co/jaRqL5Cpnk
Important letter of the Ukrainian Jewish community to Russia President Putin. http://t.co/tUnsg1EyxJ
Leaving Stockholm early today for London. Will be two days of talks over a wide range of subjects. But Russia will be the obvious focus.
And now taking off from Luleå after most interesting day here. A dynamic and globalised part of Sweden.
End of ice breaking season for Oden already tomorrow. Very early this year. In July heading back to the Arctic. http://t.co/uWiwh6wryI
Paid a visit to Swedish ice breaker and Arctic research platform Oden in Luleå port. Been to North Pole 7 timre. http://t.co/NqjTUlg7Va
And now meeting students at the Luleå Technological University. Everything on the agenda. I expect many questions on Russia. And EU.
Paid a visit to huge Facebook data center by Luleå. Only they gave outside of US. A hub in our rapidly growing world of hyperconnectivity.
The real minority on Crimea fear bloodshed as a result of Russian aggression.  http://t.co/LBdf2rvwdD
Off for a day in Luleå in Northern Sweden. Discussing Europe. Visiting Facebook center. Information about Arctic and icebreaker issues.
Another day of crisis. Russia just continues. Prepares annexation of Crimea. Clearly wants regime change in Kiev. But highly likely to fail.
Russia independent media reports of Russian forces laying minefields blocking access from other parts of Ukraine to Crimea.
OSCE observers prevented from entering Crimea. And large  Russian troops movements observed. Preparations for southern Ukraine?
Here two Ambassadors on development assistance cooperation between Sweden and US. http://t.co/tbkQFaFUYg
Important that now also EU's Cathy Ashton visits Iran and tries to pursue dialogue. Hardliners probably not happy. http://t.co/8EYRAF7g83:
Now the clampdown on the media on Crimea has started in earnest. I fear more will come. http://t.co/cSgqwDyxUB
Yes, perhaps "the best parallel is with Prague’s Velvet Revolution of 1989". Ukraine seeks its new future. http://t.co/05CjZ2En7O
Positive mood on the Nordic Cyprus seminar in Brussels today. On all the opportunities of reunified Cyprus. http://t.co/mx7cpfCGsn
Soon taking off from Tallinn after very good NB8/V4 meeting in Narva and interesting day also otherwise in northeastern Estonia.
Striking and attractive contrast between old Town Hall and the ultramodern college building in Narva. http://t.co/ttW5hgGDNQ
With @sikorskiradek by the Narva river looking at Russia on the other side. http://t.co/wcipfYmEir
Very impressed with plans to renovate fascinating historic Krenholm area in Narva.  http://t.co/xZNzHOpOvj
At our press conference here in Narva we call for an EU monitoring mission to the different parts of Ukraine. http://t.co/DYzuML8SEv
Rather somber atmosphere in our discussion here in Narva on the security situation in Europe. We must reflect deeper on consequences.
Morning in Narva. The old Swedish City Hall has miraculously survived all the wars of this historic city. http://t.co/t3DYFbHuWR
Warning of risk of bloodshed on Crimea from @AstridThors of OSCE after her visit. http://t.co/aWXorDs80g
Strong EU reaction against Russia aggression in Ukraine by our heads of state and government in Brussels today, http://t.co/xfYuoFX7sf
Soon off for dinner with all Baltic, Nordic and Visegrad FM's in old Narva Castle. Looking into Russia. Discussing Ukraine.
Danish and Swedish aircraft now wheels up from Donetsk. Heading for Tallinn in Estonia. http://t.co/Jz63gx8Jbv
Crimea vote today in occupied parliament obviously escalates the crisis. EU appeal on Monday for de-escalation steps wasn't heard.
Calm and confident atmosphere today in Donetsk. Some violent pro-Russian thugs yesterday at demonstration. But police maintains order.
Very good talks with Governor Sergey Taruta and key industrialist Rinat Ahmetov here in sunny Donetsk. Strong support for United Ukraine.
З нетерпінням чекаю на можливість знову відвідати Донецьк. Донбас відіграє ключову роль у відродженні української економіки.
С нетерпением жду возможности снова посетить Донецк. Донбасс играет ключевую роль в возрождении украинской экономики.
Donets is the hearth of the important industrial region of Donbass. Key to the economy also of Ukraine. Big European potential.
Gray early morning by the mighty Dnepr. Now off to the heart of Eastern Ukraine in Donets together with @martinlidegaard.
Good US summary of the different false Russian propaganda statements on Ukraine. http://t.co/aPT2N3Cp7B
As so many times before it was an honour to meet legendary Crimea Tatar leader Mustafa Cemilev. http://t.co/9Kd0nLot4n
It's moving to see the stories of the young people of the Maidan brutally killed by the snipers. http://t.co/vktWUiWgyS
Close to midnight here just finished meeting with Ukraine Finance Minister Sjlapak. Desperate financial situation. Reforms and help needed.
Meeting with the Acting President of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov. Support for constitutional development. http://t.co/1iUrhiIOq7
Here me and @Martin Lidegaard paying tribute to the victims on the Maidan earlier today. http://t.co/hu8Ygu8QHk
Children giving their tribute to those killed on the Maidan. http://t.co/DztLevFovw
Maidan looks very different today from when I was here last time. And a hundred persons lost their lives here. http://t.co/KA8BVyqYuI
Kiev is actually closer to Stockholm than Brussels us. Not by much, but still.
Now wheels up for Kiev and talks there. Hope to be able to start visit by going to Institutskaya vul and honour those that lost their lives.
In Kiev later today I hope to be able to see also friend Mustafa Cemilev. Situation of Tatars the real minority issue on Crimea. @CrimeaEU
Interesting. Moscow professor sacked after saying "This Has Already Happened" on Crimea occupation. http://t.co/egsqKgU9wh
Looking forward to going to Kiev for talks tomorrow with Denmark FM @martinlidegaard and meeting also Norway FM @borgebrende there.
Now the Royal a Palace for meeting with Royal Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs with also parliamentary leaders. Will brief on Ukraine.
In midst of Ukraine crisis, debates in Parliament also on first Turkey and then Bosnia. Certainly important issues as well.
Russia Today anchor Abby Martin speaks out against Russian invasion of Crimea. 

http://t.co/ndotMuoemt
So Ukraine now has got its own Quisling. Sitting on foreign soil begging a foreign army to give his country to him.
And now wheels up back to Stockholm. We had a remarkable unity of views in EU today on gravity of actions Russia has taken against Ukraine.
Did quick interview with @cnn after our EU meetings. Stressed also the grave threat of further Russian aggressive acts against Ukraine.
EU states that what we have seen from Russia against Ukraine is "aggression".
Members of Russia Presidential Council on Human Rights consider invasion of Ukraine "completely inappropriate". http://t.co/arWTy7ecgK
Moscow blocks Ukraine websites giving views different from the heavy state propaganda in Russia. A telling sign. http://t.co/gaJj35FZ9Q
My remarks to the media on entering building of emergency EU meeting on Russia and Ukraine. http://t.co/tXh2O5vOuG
Soon wheels up for Brussels and emergency EU meeting. We must clearly condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Crimea.
Suspension of preparations for G8 Summit in Sochi in June clear political signal to Russia.  http://t.co/yq5DkbJbu3
Different trends in Iran at the moment, but loosening internet restrictions clearly an encouraging one. http://t.co/SRFE4LrBwh
When discussing the situation on the Crimea, one should never forget the Crimean Tatars and their rights. http://t.co/VAxWTap9nJ
When Russian forces demands that Ukraine forces in Crimea surrender weapons it's clearly a military occupation that is taking place.
On the centenary of 1914, we are suddenly in a Europe of invasion, aggression and threats of massive use of military force.
US says "Russia’s clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity ... breach of international law" http://t.co/DvxSwYxJ3V
EU FM's for emergency meeting on Ukraine Monday. Worst European crisis since a long time back. We need a strong EU in an unstable Europe.
Russian military intervention in Ukraine is clearly against international law and principles of European security.  http://t.co/Oby0UXmROs
Talked also with Ukraine PM Yatsenjuk on the acute situation. Resist provocations, but preserve and uphold Ukraine state rights everywhere.
In contact with Ukraine Acting FM Deshchytsia as well as EU colleagues on the evolving situation also in Crimea.
No country has the right to intervene militarily in the local issues of another sovereign country. That's a fundamental principle.
Obvious that there is Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Likely immediate aim is to set up puppet pro-Russian semi state in Crimea.
I fear we see a scenario we have seen before playing out in Crimea now. Russia establishing new gray zones and frozen conflicts.
Crimea situation alarming. Russia must immediately withdraw forces it controls to agreed base area. Simferopol is clearly outside this area
Conflict in Crimea must be averted.  All must fully respect territorial integrity, international agreements and rule of law.
Landed in Stockholm after long day over Siberia. Flight touched on the Arctic sea. Much to follow up in Europe.
Leaving Tokyo on JAL 787 heading back to Europe. A long day over Siberia ahead. http://t.co/g0auQG2moi
岸田外務大臣との会談は、ウクライナ情勢と中国との関係が主な話題だった。多くの情報を共有でき、建設的な対話ができた。

Checking out from iconic Okura hotel in downtown Tokyo. One of my distinct global favourites.   http://t.co/wJASWXjt9b
Few things are as delightful as a Japanese garden. Here at the International House in Tokyo this afternoon. http://t.co/vFbhlw3cc7
Also talked from Tokyo with new Italy FM @FedericaMog. Congratulated. Updated on Ukraine situation. Looks forward to next meeting.
Somewhat surprising, but @rt_com delivers a reasonably balanced account of background to the Crimea issues. http://t.co/0XM0m5DWwa
I would urge Yanukovich to immediately return to Kiev, explain why he abandoned his position and declare all his financial interests.
Serms as if Viktor Yanukovich now has confirmed that he has abandoned his position and fled his country. By all standards has thus resigned.
Most of our discussion with Japan FM Kishida was over developments in Ukraine and relations with China. Informative and constructive.
Photo looks very formal, but we had an extremely good and constructive meeting and dinner with Japan FM Kishida. http://t.co/WJK0JTWRxs
Just passed restaurant "Belarus Home Cooking" here in Tokyo. The world is getting smaller. Unfortunately have another dinner.
Priority for new Ukraine government must be to get to the root of all corrupt structures. Billions can be saved. Decent governance started.
Good that @MiroslavLajcak and V4 colleagues are also heading to Kiev today. Support to new government in everyone's interest.
スウェーデンから日本への音楽の輸出は良好だ。ABBAからAviciiまで、日本からスウェーデンへの音楽の輸出の12倍だ。
今まで19人の日本人科学者や作家がノーベル賞受賞のためストックホルムを訪れた。今後も日本人受賞者がスウェーデンを訪れるだろう。
日本の音楽産業の市場規模は世界第二位だ。スウェーデンからの輸出拡大の可能性がある分野だ。
Excellent that EU:s Cathy Ashton will be back in Kiev already on  Monday for discussions with the new government.
Japan is the 2nd largest music industry market in the world. Strong potential for further Swedish exports.
19 Japanese scientists and authors have made the trip to Stockholm to receive the Nobel prize. Sure there are more to come.
Swedish music export to Japan is strong. From Abba to Avicii. 12 times the Japanese music export to Sweden.
Meeting with Swedish companies in Tokyo. Encouraging to see that new innovation entrepreneurs are coming here. Market open for new thinking.
New start for Ukraine will require a broad coalition for reforms and strong political leadership. And international support will be there.
After two decades of truly failed policies Ukraine's GDP per capita is still below what it was in 1989 and only 10% of the EU average.
This is the time for Ukraine to get a truly new start with truly radical reforms. Then it can recover ground lost during past decades.
No doubt @Yatsenyuk_AP takes over a most challenging situation as new Ukraine PM. Last regime took country to ruin. IMF and others must help
The darkness of North Korea vividly obvious in this image of the region from space. http://t.co/zd5Cqc7Ecw
Did interview in bookstore with Yomiuri newspaper. Great interest in Ukraine issue and China developments. http://t.co/TyIspm8f8z
Briefly in one of the world's most beautiful bookstores - Tsutaya Books here in Tokyo. Could have stayed. http://t.co/CyOjx4D9xj
Close to 40 million people in wider urban area of Tokyo. Biggest in the world. But the air is clear and traffic flows smoothly. Can be done.
Nice to be in the clear air of Tokyo. And now I'm off to meeting with new National Security Council. http://t.co/b1zEBwQSLs
About to leave China after four days in Shanghai, Shandong and Beijing. Tokyo/Haneda next destination. http://t.co/tCXNNN7WXF
Leaving downtown Beijing early in the morning. Looking at @BeijingAir it looks as if air pollution went through the roof during the night.
Also the official Chinese news agency has highlighted the response to my Weibo tweet on the air pollution.  http://t.co/WVr9QzWrot
But we have also discuss need for deeper dialogue between EU and China on global climate issues prior to 2015 COP meeting in Paris.
Air pollution has got worse during the day says @BeijingAir. Could well be record levels. Everyone talks about it. Rapidly growing issue.
Lasf formal meeting here was with Ms. Fu Ying who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress. Good as always.
Min "tweet" på kinesiska Weibo om luftföroreningarna har nu lett till publicitet i bl a Folkets Dagblad här. Och ner. http://t.co/SIjTkfoVJq

Morning in Beijing. Pollution at dangerous levels @BeijingAir. Starting my day with seeing China FM Wang Yi. Bilateral and global issues.
It us highly disturbing that Uganda President now has signed and approved the highly controversial anti-gay legislation.

Important that Cathy Ashton from EU is in Ukraine today. We want to listen to see how we can help the country get the new start necessary.
Congratulations to Estonia on its Independence Day.
My day here in Shandong started with visiting the tomb of Confucius in Qufu. Lived and worked 500 BC. http://t.co/KLTjvrYY02
Has been decidedly bad days for Lenin statues in Ukraine recently. You might ask why there were still there. http://t.co/skgDsUolNf
Been in touch with EU's Catherine Ashton on immediate action related to Ukraine. We must support formation of inclusive government.
Earlier today in Shanghai with our Ambassador Lars Fredén and Consul General Viktoria Li. Spring in the air http://t.co/HANrFR9YuG
Qufu is the city where Confucius was born and lived 2.500 years ago and left his lasting and strong impression on the development of China.
It was certainly impressive to ride with the fast modern Chinese train to Qufu, where I am at the moment. http://t.co/ewsyTat2MR
Now taking the very fast and modern train three hours from Shanghai to Qufu in the Shandong province. Impressive.
Remarkable that Viktor Yanukovich simple fled from and abandoned his functions and duties. Rada is today the legitimate state institution.
Breakfast with Swedish business representatives high above most of the Shanghai skyline. http://t.co/nF4BBpKCs2
EU is certainly following the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine minute by minute. http://t.co/7ko1XXfiwn
The lesson of revolutions is the need to immediately focus on the day after. And the day thereafter. Otherwise risk everything goes wrong.
New Ukraine government needs both radical economic reform package and radical international support efforts.  Need to move fast.
I warmly welcome that UN Security Council finally decides resolution on humanitarian rights and access in Syria. Unanimous.
It is imperative that agreed new government in Ukraine is formed urgently to secure order, safeguard integrity and start reforms.
The territorial integrity of Ukraine is fundamental. It is guaranteed by Russia and all other European countries.
If Yanukovich still President of Ukraine he has a duty to sign decisions of the Rada also putting agreement concluded into force.
Fascinating dinner discussing challenges of China. But also trying to keep in touch with Ukraine events. http://t.co/GO9zGohrrS
Just ended #scf13 discussions here, and they were probably the best we have had since we started these dialogues on China in Stockholm 2007.
Panels at #scf13 show high level of political tension between China and Japan. Always risk that mistrust in crisis leads to miscalculation.
And of course great appreciation to @emmabonino for all her contributions as FM of Italy!
I congratulate @FedericaMog on becoming new FM of Italy.
Early morning in Shanghai. Looks grey. Checking news from Europe. Soon discussion at Stockholm China Forum on relations China/EU/US.
Now confirmed that President Yanukovich tried to get the Army as well to move against protesters. He wanted same in 2004 but was stopped.
Congratulations also to @sikorskiradek @LaurentFabius and FM Steinmeier for successful and important diplomatic effort in Kiev.
It remains important that those responsible for killings and human rights violations in Ukraine are brought to justice.
Congratulations on political agreement now signed in Kiev. New government with new powers must now tackle also massive economic challenges.
Arrived in Shanghai. Talked to Canada FM @HonJohnBaird on visit in Australia on our EU Ukraine efforts at the moment.
Did interview also with @cnn on Ukraine situation and possible moves forward after boarding the plane here in Munich.
Leaving for China means going to an area where Twitter is blocked. A true shame. But you might not hear from me here for a couple of days.
Taking off on flights that hopefully will bring me some time tomorrow to Shanghai. But slightly tight with time after long Brussels meeting.
White House calls for Yanukovich to withdraw security forces from downtown Kiev and for protests to be peaceful. Would be important step.
At our FM meeting here in Brussels we also gave total support to the political efforts of our three colleagues in Kiev.
Scope of implementation of EU measures will be taken forward in light of developments in Ukraine.
EU decides as a matter of urgency on asset freeze and visa ban on those responsible for violence and excessive force in Kiev.
Here my remarks to Swedish Parliament published also in Ukrainska Pravda.  http://t.co/3d9sNtESJp
I had very brief remarks as I arrived at the EU building here in Brussels. The situation is extremely serious. http://t.co/dJLE5gjewf
Wheels up for Brussels with Estonia FM @urmaspaet. I suspect meeting on Ukraine will be delayed. Troika mission in Kiev should be priority.
At least a good start of the talks with Iran on a comprehensive nuclear deal. Intense schedule coming months. http://t.co/2d1yHix9K6
Talked with a European observer by the Maidan in Kiev. No doubt live ammunition used. Many casualties. Need for fast medical help.
Truly alarming development in Kiev. We repeat our call for all to avoid violence and for regime to initiate truly honest political process.
Among everything else, our work for freedom on and of the net remains a priority. http://t.co/UEpfWg1BlP
Starting my day in Stockholm with cabinet meeting. Then to Brussels for EU meeting on Ukraine. And then onwards towards Shanghai.
"EU helping freedom fighters in Ukraine". http://t.co/20mrSFLm5u
International pressure forces President Yanukovich into temporary truce. But is he ready for political and democratic solution? So far not.
Very soon on @AlJazeera to talk about the dramatic situation in Ukraine and the EU efforts to stop violence and support democracy.
Why does President Yanukovich suddenly fire the Commander of the Ukraine Army?  Reason clearly related to present crisis. Ominous sign.
Russia @mfa_russia talks about "attempted coup d'etat" and need for "anti-terrorist operation" in Ukraine. It's chilling to hear.
Excellent that @sikorskiradek is heading to Kiev already tonight. We just coordinated. Voice of Europe must be clear and strong.
Talked also with @bbcworldservice on European reaction to the violence and repression in Ukraine.
Before my official annual foreign policy statement in Parliament today, I had these words to say about Ukraine. http://t.co/qxzDoKwwBc
Was interviewed on BBC World TV on tragic and dramatic situation in Ukraine. http://t.co/M0FMefrI3U
Excellent that Catherine Ashton has now called the FM's of EU to an extraordinary meeting in Brussels tomorrow at 14:00.
Yesterday in Brussels seven nations signed the charter to set up new European Institute for Peace @Eurpeace
Here is our government statement on foreign policy presented in parliament today. http://t.co/36Nw8Ue3iT
Foreign policy debate in Parliament today. Strong unity in condemning violence and deaths in Kiev. Support for European dream for Ukraine.
We must be clear: Ultimate responsibility for deaths and violence is with President Yanukovich. He has blood on his hands.
Only person who can now stop catastrophe in Ukraine is President Yanukovich. His vacillation and violence responsible for situation.
Regime seems to have shut down Channel 5 independent TV station in Ukraine. Regime repression and violence unacceptable.
EU will not hesitate on measures against interests of persons associated with repression and violence in Ukraine.
Reports now that nine persons have been killed in Kiev today. Everyone has responsibility to take country back from brink of catastrophe.
Everyone in Ukraine has a responsibility to secure a peaceful and non-violent solution after the tragic deaths of this day.
Highly worrying news from Kiev. Everyone must avoid every form of violence. Only dialogue and democracy can bring a solution.
I'm worried by renewed outbreak of fighting in South Sudan. Everyone must respect ceasefire and move towards political solution.
We are looking at strengthening the Swedish contribution to the @un_unisma peacekeeping operation in Mali.
I warmly welcome the signing of the border agreement between Estonia and Russia today.
Important and encouraging meeting between Estonia and Russia FM's Paet and Lavrov in Moscow today. Good relations important for all.
Staring this sunny day with meeting of Royal Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs chaired by HM King and with Parliament leaders.
Today in Vienna start of talks on comprehensive Iran nuclear agreement. Will be possible with genuine will to compromise on both sides.
Saw that three rockets were fired towards Timbuktu in Mali late yesterday. This highlight challenges for @UN_MINUSMA and peace process.
UN NoKorea report: Gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a State that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.
Devastating report on grave crimes against human rights in North Korea. Important to put on the international agenda. http://t.co/PuWvnxZEAq
Slowly returning to Stockholm. Today we have visit by Norway PM @erna_solberg. Important day for Norway with @grunnloven200 celebrations.

Dinner reception here in Bamako tonight. Listen to persons in different peace operations. But then starting the journey back to Sweden.
But the beautiful cultural heritage of Timbuktu is to a large extent still there. Peace has come. http://t.co/Lmeh0aKk9s
UN-painted, Ukraine-operated and Swedish-built aircraft took us all the way to Timbuktu in the Sahara. http://t.co/OcTTBK8i9f

Back in Bamako from a day in Timbuktu. Fascinating dialogue also with civil society representatives. http://t.co/9UZ3GBCk9k
New day of talks here in Mali. Political process with reconciliation and development in vast Northern areas of the country must accelerate.
Good that US is now stepping up its engagement on cooperation in Arctic Council. Will take over as chair in 2015. http://t.co/EOJlNnmXVO
Full days of political talks here in Bamako with Mali state leadership and UN and EU. Now for somewhat more relax dinner by Niger River.
Is it normal that US wins over Russia in ice hockey? I'm just asking.
In Mali 65% is 25 years or younger. At independence in 1960 country had 3 million inhabitants. Today 15 million. And growing very fast.
I congratulate @GebranBassil on being appointed new Foreign Minister of Lebanon.
I welcome that efforts to form a new government in Lebanon have now been crowned with success. Very important for stability of the country.
